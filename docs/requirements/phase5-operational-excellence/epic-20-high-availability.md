# Phase 5 Epic 20: High Availability and Disaster Recovery

## Overview
High availability and disaster recovery ensure the certificate management system maintains continuous operations even during failures, disasters, or maintenance. This epic implements active-active deployment patterns, automated failover mechanisms, and comprehensive disaster recovery procedures to achieve 99.99% availability and minimal data loss.

## User Stories
1. **20.1 - Active-Active Deployment**: Multi-region active-active architecture with automatic failover

## Dependencies
- Epic 16 (Multi-Tenancy) - Tenant-aware HA
- Epic 17 (Security Infrastructure) - HSM and Vault HA
- Epic 19 (Geographic Distribution) - Regional deployment foundation
- All previous epics for comprehensive HA coverage

## Success Metrics
- 99.99% availability (52.56 minutes downtime/year)
- < 30 seconds automatic failover time
- Zero data loss (RPO = 0)
- < 5 minutes recovery time (RTO)
- 100% successful DR drills
- No single points of failure

## Technical Considerations
- Active-active architecture patterns
- Consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos)
- Multi-region data replication
- Split-brain prevention
- Automated health checks
- Self-healing capabilities
- Chaos engineering testing
- Zero-downtime upgrades
