## Dependencies
- Epic 8 (Lifecycle Management) - Historical data for predictions
- Epic 9 (Monitoring) - Metrics for ML training
- Epic 11 (Discovery) - Complete certificate inventory
- Epic 18 (Analytics) - Analytics infrastructure

## Success Metrics
- 95% prediction accuracy for certificate issues
- 90% reduction in certificate-related incidents
- < 1 hour mean time to predict issues
- 99% automated remediation success rate
- 80% reduction in manual operations
- Zero unexpected certificate expirations

## Technical Considerations
