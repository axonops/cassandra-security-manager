# 21.1 - Predictive Certificate Management

## User Story
**As a** certificate operations manager  
**I want** AI-powered predictive certificate management  
**So that** we prevent certificate issues before they occur and achieve autonomous operations

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Predictive features can be developed separately from reactive management
- **Negotiable**: ML models and automation levels are configurable
- **Valuable**: Prevents outages and reduces operational overhead dramatically
- **Estimable**: 5 sprints for comprehensive predictive system
- **Small**: Focused on predictive analytics and intelligent automation only
- **Testable**: Prediction accuracy and automation success are measurable
