# Phase 2 Epic 06: Secure Connection Bundle Management

## Overview
Cassandra Secure Connection Bundles (SCBs) simplify client connectivity by packaging certificates, configuration, and connection metadata. This epic implements automated SCB generation, secure distribution, and lifecycle management to streamline client application deployment and reduce configuration complexity.

## User Stories
1. **06.1 - SCB Generation and Distribution**: Automated generation and secure distribution of connection bundles
2. **06.2 - Bundle Lifecycle Management**: Versioning, updates, and lifecycle management for connection bundles

## Dependencies
- Epic 1 (CA Hierarchy) - Certificate chains for bundles
- Epic 2 (Certificates) - Client certificates for authentication
- Epic 4 (Storage) - Bundle storage and retrieval
- A4 (Security) - Secure distribution mechanisms

## Success Metrics
- SCB generation time < 30 seconds
- Bundle size < 5MB (compressed)
- 100% configuration accuracy
- Zero credential exposure during distribution
- 99.9% bundle availability
- Support for 10+ client platforms

## Technical Considerations
- ZIP-based bundle format with standardized structure
- Embedded certificates and configuration files
- Platform-specific client configurations
- Secure distribution channels (HTTPS, signed bundles)
- Version management and compatibility tracking
- Automatic bundle updates and notifications
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Support for multiple Cassandra clusters
