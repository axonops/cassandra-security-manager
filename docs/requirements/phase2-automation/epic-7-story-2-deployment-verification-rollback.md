# User Story 07.2 - Deployment Verification and Rollback

## User Story
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** automatic verification and rollback of certificate deployments  
**So that** system availability is maintained and issues are quickly resolved

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Verification and rollback can be developed separately from deployment
- **Negotiable**: Verification criteria and rollback triggers are configurable
- **Valuable**: Prevents service disruption from failed certificate deployments
- **Estimable**: 2 sprints for complete verification and rollback system
- **Small**: Focused on post-deployment validation and recovery only
- **Testable**: Verification success/failure and rollback scenarios are measurable

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Comprehensive Post-Deployment Verification
```gherkin
Given certificate deployment has completed
When verifying deployment success
Then perform comprehensive verification:
{
  "verification_suite": {
    "certificate_validation": {
      "file_integrity": "SHA-256 checksum verification",
      "certificate_parsing": "Valid X.509 certificate structure",
      "chain_validation": "Complete certificate chain verification",
      "expiration_check": "Certificate not expired",
      "key_pair_validation": "Private key matches certificate"
    },
    "service_verification": {
      "cassandra_startup": "Cassandra service starts successfully",
      "tls_handshake": "TLS connections work correctly",
      "cluster_connectivity": "Node joins cluster successfully",
      "client_connections": "Client applications can connect",
      "replication_health": "Replication working across nodes"
    },
    "performance_verification": {
      "connection_latency": "< 100ms connection establishment",
      "throughput_impact": "< 5% performance degradation",
      "memory_usage": "No memory leaks detected",
      "cpu_impact": "< 10% CPU usage increase"
    }
  }
}
And implement verification timeouts:
  - Service startup: 5 minutes maximum
  - Network connectivity: 2 minutes maximum
  - Performance baseline: 10 minutes monitoring
  - Overall verification: 15 minutes total timeout
```

### Scenario: Health Check Integration
```gherkin
Given various health check systems monitor Cassandra
When integrating with health checks
Then support multiple health check types:
  | Health Check Type    | Implementation                         |
  | Application health  | HTTP endpoints for service status       |
  | Database health     | CQL query execution verification        |
  | Cluster health      | Node status in cluster ring             |
  | Replication health  | Data consistency across replicas       |
  | Network health      | Inter-node communication verification   |
  | Load balancer health| LB health check endpoint status         |
And implement health check monitoring:
  - Continuous monitoring during verification period
  - Baseline comparison with pre-deployment metrics
  - Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
  - Integration with existing monitoring systems
  - Custom health check definition support
```

### Scenario: Automated Rollback Triggers
```gherkin
Given deployments may cause service degradation
When automatic rollback conditions are met
Then trigger rollback based on:
  | Rollback Trigger     | Condition                              |
  | Service failure     | Cassandra service fails to start       |
  | Connection failure  | TLS handshake failures > 10%           |
  | Performance degradation| Response time increase > 50%         |
  | Error rate spike    | Error rate increase > 20%              |
  | Cluster instability | Node cannot join cluster ring           |
  | Health check failure| Health checks fail for > 5 minutes     |
  | Manual trigger      | Administrator initiates rollback       |
And implement rollback decision logic:
  - Weighted scoring system for multiple factors
  - Configurable threshold values
  - Grace period before triggering rollback
  - Manual override capabilities
  - Escalation procedures for edge cases
```

### Scenario: Rollback Execution Process
```gherkin
Given rollback has been triggered
When executing rollback procedure
Then follow systematic rollback process:
  | Rollback Phase       | Actions                                |
  | Immediate safety    | Stop accepting new connections          |
  | Service stop        | Gracefully stop Cassandra service      |
  | Certificate restore | Restore backed-up certificates          |
  | Configuration restore| Restore backed-up configuration files  |
  | Service restart     | Restart Cassandra with old certificates|
  | Verification        | Verify rollback success                 |
  | Traffic restoration | Resume normal traffic handling          |
And implement rollback safeguards:
  - Backup verification before rollback
  - Rollback progress tracking
  - Rollback timeout handling
  - Emergency manual intervention
  - Post-rollback verification
```

### Scenario: Backup and Restore Management
```gherkin
Given rollbacks require reliable backups
When managing backup and restore
Then implement comprehensive backup system:
  | Backup Component     | Implementation                         |
  | Certificate files   | Point-in-time file system snapshots    |
  | Configuration files | Version-controlled configuration backup |
  | Service state       | Service configuration and runtime state|
  | Database schema     | Schema backup if certificates affect it |
  | System state        | System-level state relevant to certificates|
And ensure backup reliability:
  - Backup integrity verification
  - Multiple backup retention periods
  - Geographic backup distribution
  - Backup encryption and security
  - Regular backup testing and validation
```

### Scenario: Granular Rollback Capabilities
```gherkin
Given different rollback scenarios need different approaches
When performing targeted rollbacks
Then support granular rollback options:
  | Rollback Scope       | Implementation                         |
  | Single node rollback| Roll back one node while others continue|
  | Service-level rollback| Roll back specific service components  |
  | Configuration rollback| Roll back config without cert changes  |
  | Partial rollback    | Roll back subset of deployed changes   |
  | Cascading rollback  | Roll back dependent components         |
And provide rollback control:
  - Interactive rollback with approval steps

  - Staged rollback with verification
  - Emergency full rollback procedures
  - Rollback impact analysis
```

### Scenario: Verification Baseline Management
```gherkin
Given verification needs baseline metrics for comparison
When establishing performance baselines
Then maintain baseline metrics:
  | Baseline Metric      | Collection Method                      |
  | Connection time     | Average TLS handshake duration          |
  | Query performance   | CQL query response times               |
  | Throughput rates    | Operations per second baseline          |
  | Error rates         | Historical error rate patterns          |
  | Resource usage      | CPU, memory, network utilization       |
And implement baseline management:
  - Automatic baseline collection
  - Seasonal baseline adjustments
  - Environment-specific baselines
  - Baseline drift detection
  - Manual baseline override capabilities
```

### Scenario: Multi-Environment Verification
```gherkin
Given deployments happen across multiple environments
When verifying in different environments

  | Environment          | Verification Adaptations               |
  | Development         | Relaxed thresholds, basic health checks |
  | Staging             | Production-like verification           |
  | Production          | Strict thresholds, comprehensive checks|
  | DR/Backup sites     | Connectivity and replication verification|
And implement environment profiles:
  - Environment-specific verification rules
  - Different rollback thresholds per environment
  - Environment-aware baseline metrics
  - Cross-environment consistency checking
  - Environment-specific approval workflows
```

### Scenario: Verification Reporting and Analytics
```gherkin
Given verification results need analysis and reporting

  - Predictive failure Modelling
```

### Scenario: Integration with Monitoring Systems
```gherkin
Given existing monitoring systems track application health
When integrating verification with monitoring
Then support monitoring integration:
  | Monitoring System    | Integration Method                     |
  | Prometheus          | Custom metrics for verification status  |
  | Grafana             | Dashboards for deployment verification  |

  - Historical deployment tracking
  - Performance regression detection
  - Integration with existing dashboards
```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Verification System Failure
```gherkin
Given verification systems may fail
When verification infrastructure fails
Then:
  - Implement verification system redundancy
  - Support manual verification procedures
  - Provide verification system health monitoring
  - Enable verification bypass with approval
  - Alert administrators of verification system issues
```

### Edge Case: Rollback System Failure
```gherkin
Given rollback systems may fail
When rollback procedures fail
Then:
  - Provide manual rollback procedures
  - Implement rollback system monitoring
  - Support emergency manual intervention
  - Maintain offline rollback documentation
  - Enable escalation to emergency response team
```

### Edge Case: Partial Service Recovery
```gherkin
Given services may partially recover during verification
When dealing with intermittent issues
Then:
  - Implement extended monitoring periods
  - Support conditional rollback based on stability
  - Provide manual decision points
  - Track partial recovery patterns
  - Enable staged rollback procedures
```

### Edge Case: Cascading Failures
```gherkin
Given certificate issues may cause cascading failures
When cascading failures occur
Then:
  - Implement dependency-aware rollback
  - Support emergency cluster-wide rollback
  - Provide failure isolation procedures
  - Enable priority-based recovery
  - Coordinate with disaster recovery procedures
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given verification and rollback involve sensitive operations
Then implement security controls:
  | Security Control     | Implementation                         |
  | Audit logging       | Complete audit trail of all operations |
  | Access controls     | Role-based access to rollback functions|
  | Approval workflows  | Multi-person approval for rollbacks    |
  | Secure communication| TLS encryption for all verification    |
  | Integrity protection| Verify backup integrity before rollback|
  | Non-repudiation     | Cryptographic proof of all actions     |
  | Privilege separation| Least privilege for verification/rollback|
  | Emergency procedures| Secure emergency access procedures     |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given verification must not significantly impact performance
Then meet these targets:
  | Performance Metric   | Target                                 |
  | Verification time   | < 5 minutes for complete verification   |
  | Rollback time       | < 2 minutes for complete rollback      |
  | Performance impact  | < 5% during verification period        |
  | Monitoring overhead | < 1% CPU/memory for verification       |
  | Network impact      | < 10% additional network utilization   |
  | Storage overhead    | < 100MB for verification artifacts     |
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Verification Metrics
```yaml
verification_metrics:
  - deployment_success_rate
  - verification_duration
  - rollback_frequency
  - performance_impact
  - health_check_pass_rate
  
alerting_rules:
  - alert: DeploymentVerificationFailure
    expr: deployment_verification_success_rate < 0.95
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "High deployment verification failure rate"
```
