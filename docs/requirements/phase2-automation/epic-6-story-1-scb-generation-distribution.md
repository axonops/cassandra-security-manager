# User Story 06.1 - SCB Generation and Distribution

## User Story
**As a** developer  
**I want** automatically generated secure connection bundles  
**So that** I can easily connect to Cassandra without complex certificate management

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: SCB generation can be developed separately from other features
- **Negotiable**: Bundle format and distribution methods are configurable
- **Valuable**: Dramatically simplifies client application development
- **Estimable**: 2 sprints for complete SCB generation and distribution
- **Small**: Focused on bundle creation and distribution only
- **Testable**: Bundle correctness and connectivity can be validated

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Automated SCB Generation
```gherkin
Given a developer needs to connect to a Cassandra cluster
When I request a secure connection bundle
Then generate a complete bundle containing:
{
  "bundle_structure": {
    "metadata.json": {
      "bundle_version": "1.0",
      "cluster_name": "production-cluster",
      "generated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "expires_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "client_id": "app-service-prod",
      "supported_drivers": ["java", "python", "nodejs", "go"]
    },
    "certificates/": {
      "ca-cert.pem": "Root CA certificate",
      "client-cert.pem": "Client certificate",
      "client-key.pem": "Client private key"
    },
    "config/": {
      "cassandra.yaml": "Client configuration",
      "driver-configs/": "Driver-specific configurations",
      "connection-profiles/": "Environment-specific profiles"
    },
    "examples/": {
      "java/": "Java connection examples",
      "python/": "Python connection examples",
      "nodejs/": "Node.js connection examples"
    },
    "README.md": "Usage instructions and examples"
  }
}
And validate bundle completeness before distribution
And ensure all certificates are valid and properly chained
```

### Scenario: Multi-Driver Configuration Support
```gherkin
Given different client drivers have different configuration requirements
When generating SCB for multiple drivers
Then include driver-specific configurations:
  | Driver      | Configuration Files                     |
  | Java        | application.conf, cassandra.yaml       |
  | Python      | cassandra.conf, connection.yaml        |
  | Node.js     | cassandra-config.json                  |
  | Go          | config.yaml, connection-params.json    |
  | .NET        | appsettings.json, cassandra.config     |

```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Certificate Expiration During Bundle Use
```gherkin
Given certificates may expire while bundle is in use
When certificate expiration approaches
Then:
  - Notify users before expiration
  - Provide updated bundles automatically
  - Implement graceful degradation
  - Support certificate rotation without downtime
  - Maintain backward compatibility
```

### Edge Case: Network Connectivity Issues
```gherkin
Given network connectivity may be limited
When bundle distribution fails
Then:
  - Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - Provide offline bundle generation options
  - Support peer-to-peer bundle sharing
  - Cache bundles locally for reuse
  - Provide alternative distribution methods
```

### Edge Case: Large-Scale Bundle Generation
```gherkin
Given thousands of clients may need bundles simultaneously
When handling high-volume requests
Then:
  - Implement request queuing and rate limiting
  - Use horizontal scaling for bundle generation
  - Optimise resource utilization
  - Provide batch generation APIs
  - Monitor system performance and capacity
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given SCBs contain sensitive authentication credentials
Then implement comprehensive security:
  | Security Control        | Implementation                         |
  | Credential protection  | Encrypt private keys in bundles        |
  | Access control         | Strong authentication for bundle access|
  | Audit logging          | Complete audit trail of all operations |
  | Secure transmission    | TLS 1.3 for all bundle transfers       |
  | Integrity protection   | Digital signatures and checksums       |
  | Time-based security    | Bundle expiration and refresh cycles   |
  | Abuse prevention       | Rate limiting and anomaly detection    |
  | Secure storage         | Encrypted storage of generated bundles |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given performance affects developer productivity
Then meet these targets:
  | Performance Metric      | Target                                 |
  | Bundle generation      | < 30 seconds for complete bundle       |
  | Bundle size            | < 5MB compressed bundle                |
  | Download speed         | > 10MB/s from global CDN              |
  | API response time      | < 500ms for bundle request             |
  | Concurrent generation  | 100+ simultaneous bundle generations   |
  | Cache hit rate         | > 80% for common bundle configurations |
```

## Integration Examples

### Java Driver Integration
```java
// Load SCB configuration
SCBConfig config = SCBLoader.loadFromBundle("cassandra-scb.zip");
CqlSession session = CqlSession.builder()
    .withCloudSecureConnectBundle(config.getBundlePath())
    .withAuthCredentials(config.getUsername(), config.getPassword())
    .build();
```

### Python Driver Integration
```python
# Load SCB configuration
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
from cassandra.auth import PlainTextAuthProvider

scb_config = load_scb_config("cassandra-scb.zip")
auth_provider = PlainTextAuthProvider(
    username=scb_config.username,
    password=scb_config.password
)
cluster = Cluster(
    cloud=scb_config.cloud_config,
    auth_provider=auth_provider
)
```
