# User Story 06.2 - Bundle Lifecycle Management

## User Story
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** comprehensive lifecycle management for secure connection bundles  
**So that** I can ensure bundles remain current, secure, and compatible across all environments

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Bundle lifecycle can be managed separately from generation
- **Negotiable**: Lifecycle policies and automation levels are configurable
- **Valuable**: Reduces operational overhead and security risks
- **Estimable**: 2 sprints for complete lifecycle management system
- **Small**: Focused on lifecycle operations only
- **Testable**: Lifecycle policies and automation can be validated

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Bundle Version Management
```gherkin
Given bundles evolve over time with updates
When managing bundle versions
Then implement comprehensive versioning:
{
  "version_strategy": {
    "semantic_versioning": "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH",
    "major_changes": ["Breaking configuration changes", "Certificate authority changes"],
    "minor_changes": ["New driver support", "Additional configuration options"],
    "patch_changes": ["Certificate renewals", "Bug fixes", "Security updates"]
  },
  "version_metadata": {
    "compatibility_matrix": "Which client versions work with bundle versions",
    "upgrade_path": "Safe upgrade sequences between versions",
    "deprecation_schedule": "Timeline for phasing out old versions",
    "support_lifecycle": "How long each version receives updates"
  }
}
And maintain backward compatibility:
  - Support multiple active versions simultaneously
  - Provide migration guides between versions
  - Automated compatibility checking
  - Gradual rollout of new versions
```

### Scenario: Automated Bundle Updates
```gherkin

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Rapid Certificate Rotation
```gherkin
Given certificates may need emergency rotation
When rapid rotation is required
Then:
  - Support hot-swapping of certificates in bundles
  - Minimise service disruption during rotation
  - Coordinate rotation across multiple environments
  - Validate new certificates before distribution
  - Provide rollback capabilities if rotation fails
```

### Edge Case: Bundle Version Conflicts
```gherkin
Given different environments may need different versions
When version conflicts arise
Then:
  - Support environment-specific version policies
  - Provide conflict detection and resolution
  - Enable manual override for special cases
  - Document version compatibility matrices
  - Implement testing for version combinations
```

### Edge Case: Mass Bundle Invalidation
```gherkin
Given security incidents may require mass invalidation
When invalidating large numbers of bundles
Then:
  - Support bulk invalidation operations
  - Provide staged invalidation to Minimise impact
  - Implement emergency communication channels
  - Coordinate with monitoring and alerting systems
  - Provide replacement bundle generation at scale
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given bundle lifecycle involves sensitive operations
Then implement security controls:
  | Security Control        | Implementation                         |
  | Change Authorisation   | Multi-person approval for lifecycle changes|
  | Audit logging          | Complete audit trail of all operations |
  | Secure storage         | Encrypted storage of all bundle versions|
  | Access controls        | Role-based access to lifecycle functions|
  | Integrity protection   | Digital signatures for all operations  |
  | Secure communication   | TLS 1.3 for all management operations  |
  | Non-repudiation        | Cryptographic proof of all actions     |
  | Privilege separation   | Least privilege for all operations     |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given lifecycle operations must not impact service
Then meet these targets:
  | Performance Metric      | Target                                 |
  | Update deployment      | < 5 minutes for global rollout         |
  | Health check response  | < 100ms for bundle health status       |
  | Analytics processing   | < 1 hour for daily analytics update    |
  | Backup operations      | < 4 hours for complete backup          |
  | Recovery time          | < 30 minutes for single bundle recovery|
  | Version comparison     | < 10ms for version compatibility check |
```
