# User Story 11.2 - Compliance Report Generation

## User Story
**As a** compliance officer  
**I want** automated generation of compliance reports for multiple regulatory frameworks  
**So that** audit requirements are efficiently met with accurate, timely documentation

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Report generation can be developed separately from audit collection
- **Negotiable**: Report formats and compliance frameworks are configurable
- **Valuable**: Reduces compliance overhead and ensures regulatory adherence
- **Estimable**: 2 sprints for complete compliance reporting system
- **Small**: Focused on report generation and compliance mapping only
- **Testable**: Report accuracy and completeness are verifiable
