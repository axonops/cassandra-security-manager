# User Story 11.1 - Detailed Audit Trail

## User Story
**As a** compliance officer  
**I want** comprehensive, immutable audit trails for all certificate operations  
**So that** regulatory requirements are met and security incidents can be investigated

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Audit trail can be developed separately from business operations
- **Negotiable**: Audit detail levels and retention policies are configurable
- **Valuable**: Essential for regulatory compliance and security investigations
- **Estimable**: 3 sprints for complete audit trail system
- **Small**: Focused on audit logging and trail management only
- **Testable**: Audit completeness and integrity are verifiable

  - Use elastic scaling for processing
  - Provide event prioritization
  - Support burst capacity planning
  - Monitor and alert on volume spikes
```

### Edge Case: Cross-Jurisdictional Compliance
```gherkin
Given different jurisdictions have different requirements
When operating across jurisdictions
Then:
  - Support multiple compliance frameworks
  - Implement data residency requirements
  - Provide jurisdiction-specific retention
  - Support cross-border data transfer controls
  - Maintain compliance documentation
```

### Edge Case: Audit Data Corruption
```gherkin
Given audit data may become corrupted
When data corruption is detected
Then:
  - Implement corruption detection
  - Provide data recovery procedures
  - Maintain multiple data copies
  - Support partial data recovery
  - Document corruption incidents
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given audit systems are high-value security targets
Then implement comprehensive security:

  | Audit of audit      | Meta-audit trail for audit system access|
  | Incident response   | Dedicated incident response for audit events|
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given audit systems must not impact operational performance
Then meet these performance targets:
  | Performance Metric   | Target                                 |
  | Event ingestion rate| 10,000+ events per second              |
