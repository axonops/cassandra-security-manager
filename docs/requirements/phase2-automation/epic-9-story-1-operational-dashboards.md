# User Story 09.1 - Operational Dashboards

## User Story
**As an** operations team member  
**I want** comprehensive real-time dashboards for certificate infrastructure monitoring  
**So that** I can quickly identify, diagnose, and resolve operational issues

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Dashboards can be developed separately from data collection
- **Negotiable**: Dashboard layouts and metrics are customizable
- **Valuable**: Provides essential operational visibility and reduces MTTR
- **Estimable**: 2 sprints for complete operational dashboard suite
- **Small**: Focused on operational monitoring and visualization only
- **Testable**: Dashboard functionality and data accuracy are verifiable

## Acceptance Criteria

Then:
  - Display last known good data with timestamps
  - Show clear indicators for stale/unavailable data
  - Provide fallback data sources where possible
  - Alert administrators of data source issues
  - Support manual data refresh capabilities
```

### Edge Case: Dashboard Performance Degradation
```gherkin
Given high load may affect dashboard performance
When dashboard performance degrades
Then:
  - Implement progressive loading for large datasets
  - Provide simplified views for low-bandwidth scenarios
  - Cache frequently accessed dashboard components
  - Support dashboard performance monitoring
  - Enable performance Optimisation mode
```

### Edge Case: Large-Scale Data Visualization
```gherkin
Given some datasets may be very large
When visualizing large datasets
Then:
  - Implement data sampling for large datasets
  - Provide data aggregation controls
  - Support drill-down from summary to detail
  - Use virtual scrolling for large lists
  - Implement efficient chart rendering
```

### Edge Case: Cross-Browser Compatibility
```gherkin
Given users may use different browsers
When ensuring compatibility
Then:
  - Test across major browsers and versions
  - Provide graceful degradation for older browsers
  - Use progressive enhancement techniques
  - Support accessibility requirements
  - Provide browser compatibility warnings
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given dashboards display sensitive operational data
Then implement security controls:
  | Security Control     | Implementation                         |
  | Access controls     | Role-based dashboard access permissions|
  | Data filtering      | Show only Authorised data per user role|
  | Audit logging       | Log all dashboard access and actions   |
  | Secure communication| HTTPS/TLS for all dashboard traffic    |
  | Session management  | Secure session handling and timeout   |
  | Data anonymization  | Anonymize sensitive data in dashboards |
  | XSS protection      | Prevent cross-site scripting attacks  |
  | CSRF protection     | Anti-CSRF tokens for dashboard actions |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given dashboard performance affects operational efficiency
Then meet these targets:
  | Performance Metric   | Target                                 |
  | Dashboard load time | < 2 seconds for initial load           |
  | Data refresh rate   | < 5 seconds for real-time updates      |
  | Query response time | < 500ms for dashboard queries          |
  | Concurrent users    | Support 100+ concurrent dashboard users|
  | Mobile performance  | < 3 seconds load time on mobile       |
  | Chart rendering     | < 1 second for complex visualizations  |
```
