# User Story 08.1 - Expiration Monitoring and Alerting

## User Story
**As a** security administrator  
**I want** proactive monitoring and alerting for certificate expiration  
**So that** certificates are renewed before they cause service disruptions

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Monitoring can be developed separately from renewal automation
- **Negotiable**: Alert thresholds and channels are configurable
- **Valuable**: Prevents service outages and security incidents
- **Estimable**: 2 sprints for comprehensive monitoring and alerting system
- **Small**: Focused on monitoring and alerting only
- **Testable**: Alert generation and delivery can be validated

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Comprehensive Certificate Inventory Tracking
```gherkin
Given all certificates must be tracked for expiration
When building certificate inventory
Then maintain comprehensive tracking:
{
  "certificate_inventory": {
    "discovery_methods": [
      "Active certificate storage scanning",
      "Deployment target discovery",
      "Network scanning integration",
      "Manual certificate registration",
      "API-driven inventory updates"
    ],
    "tracked_attributes": {
      "basic_info": {
        "serial_number": "Unique certificate identifier",
        "subject_dn": "Certificate subject details",
        "issuer_dn": "Certificate authority information",
        "fingerprint": "SHA-256 certificate fingerprint"
      },
      "validity_info": {
        "not_before": "Certificate valid from date",
        "not_after": "Certificate expiration date",
        "days_remaining": "Calculated days until expiration",
        "renewal_window": "Optimal renewal time window"
      },
      "deployment_info": {
        "deployment_targets": "Where certificate is deployed",
        "service_dependencies": "Services using this certificate",
        "business_criticality": "Impact level if certificate fails",
        "maintenance_windows": "Allowed renewal time windows"
      }
    }
  }
}
And ensure inventory accuracy:
  - Real-time inventory updates
  - Automated discovery reconciliation
  - Manual verification procedures
  - Duplicate detection and resolution
  - Historical inventory tracking
```

### Scenario: Configurable Alert Thresholds
```gherkin
Given different certificates have different renewal requirements
When configuring alert thresholds
Then support flexible threshold configuration:
  | Threshold Type       | Configuration Options                  |
  | Time-based thresholds| 90, 60, 30, 14, 7, 3, 1 days before expiry|
  | Certificate type     | Different thresholds for different cert types|
  | Business criticality | Higher priority certs get earlier alerts|
  | Environment specific | Different thresholds per environment   |
  | Custom thresholds    | User-defined threshold combinations    |
And implement threshold logic:
  - Multiple threshold levels per certificate
  - Escalating alert severity over time
  - Threshold inheritance from policies
  - Override capabilities for special cases
  - Threshold effectiveness tracking
```

### Scenario: Multi-Channel Alert Delivery
```gherkin
Given different stakeholders need different alert methods
When delivering expiration alerts

```

### Scenario: Alert Content and Context
```gherkin
Given alerts must provide actionable information
When generating alert content
Then include comprehensive details:
{
  "alert_template": {
    "header": {
      "severity": "CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
      "certificate_id": "cert-12345",
      "days_remaining": 7,
      "expiration_date": "2024-02-15T10:30:00Z"
    },
    "certificate_details": {
      "common_name": "cassandra-node-1.prod.local",
      "subject_alternative_names": ["10.1.1.100", "cassandra-1"],
      "issuer": "Production Intermediate CA",
      "deployment_locations": ["prod-cluster-1", "prod-cluster-2"]
    },

  - Language localization support
  - Branding and formatting options
  - Dynamic content based on certificate attributes
```

### Scenario: Alert Routing and Escalation
```gherkin
Given different certificates require different response procedures
When routing alerts
Then implement intelligent routing:
  | Routing Criteria     | Routing Rules                          |
  | Certificate type    | Route based on cert purpose (CA, server, client)|
  | Business criticality| Route to different teams based on impact|
  | Environment         | Route to environment-specific teams     |
  | Time of day         | Route to on-call vs business hours teams|
  | Escalation path     | Escalate if no Acknowledgement received  |
And implement escalation procedures:
  - Primary team notification
  - Escalation after timeout (2 hours)
  - Executive escalation for critical certificates
  - Cross-team notification for dependencies
  - Emergency contact procedures
```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Mass Certificate Expiration
```gherkin
Given multiple certificates may expire simultaneously
When mass expiration events occur
Then:
  - Implement intelligent alert batching
  - Prioritize alerts by business impact
  - Provide emergency renewal procedures
  - Support bulk renewal operations
  - Coordinate with emergency response teams
```

### Edge Case: Alert System Failure
```gherkin
Given alert systems may fail
When alert delivery systems are down
Then:
  - Implement redundant alert channels
  - Provide offline alert queuing
  - Support manual alert verification
  - Maintain backup communication methods
  - Monitor alert system health continuously
```

### Edge Case: Clock Skew and Time Zone Issues
```gherkin
Given distributed systems may have time Synchronisation issues
When dealing with time-sensitive expiration data
Then:
  - Use UTC for all internal calculations
  - Account for clock skew in expiration calculations
  - Provide time zone-aware alert delivery
  - Implement NTP monitoring for time accuracy
  - Include time source information in alerts
```

### Edge Case: Certificate Discovery Gaps
```gherkin
Given some certificates may not be discovered automatically
When certificate inventory is incomplete
Then:
  - Implement multiple discovery methods
  - Support manual certificate registration
  - Provide discovery gap reporting
  - Enable certificate import from external sources
  - Monitor inventory completeness metrics
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given monitoring systems access sensitive certificate information
Then implement security controls:
  | Security Control     | Implementation                         |
  | Access controls     | Role-based access to monitoring data   |
  | Data encryption     | Encrypt sensitive certificate metadata |
  | Audit logging       | Complete audit trail of all monitoring |
  | Secure communication| TLS encryption for all monitoring traffic|
  | Alert integrity     | Digital signatures for critical alerts |
  | Privacy protection  | Anonymize sensitive data in alerts     |
  | Incident response   | Security incident procedures for alerts|
  | Compliance tracking | Track monitoring compliance requirements|
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given monitoring must not impact system performance
Then meet these targets:
  | Performance Metric   | Target                                 |
  | Scan frequency      | Every 15 minutes for inventory updates  |
  | Alert delivery      | < 5 minutes from threshold trigger     |
  | Dashboard response  | < 2 seconds for dashboard loading      |
  | Query performance   | < 500ms for certificate searches       |
  | System overhead     | < 2% CPU/memory usage for monitoring   |
  | Storage efficiency  | < 1GB storage per 10,000 certificates  |
```

## Integration Examples

### Prometheus Metrics
```yaml
certificate_expiration_days:
  type: gauge
  help: Days until certificate expiration
  labels: [cert_id, common_name, environment]

certificate_alert_sent:
  type: counter
  help: Number of expiration alerts sent
  labels: [severity, channel, cert_type]
```

### Slack Alert Template
