# User Story 08.2 - Automated Certificate Renewal

## User Story
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** intelligent automated certificate renewal  
**So that** certificates are refreshed proactively without manual intervention or service disruption

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Renewal automation can be developed separately from monitoring
- **Negotiable**: Renewal policies and automation levels are configurable
- **Valuable**: Eliminates manual renewal overhead and prevents service outages
- **Estimable**: 3 sprints for complete automated renewal system
- **Small**: Focused on renewal automation and policies only
- **Testable**: Renewal success/failure scenarios are measurable

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Policy-Based Renewal Decision Making
```gherkin
Given certificates have different renewal requirements
When determining renewal eligibility
Then evaluate renewal policies:
{
  "renewal_policies": {
    "automatic_renewal_conditions": {
      "certificate_types": ["server", "client", "service"],
      "minimum_days_remaining": 30,
      "maximum_days_remaining": 90,
      "business_hours_only": false,
      "maintenance_window_required": true
    },
    "approval_required_conditions": {
      "high_risk_certificates": ["root_ca", "intermediate_ca"],
      "production_environment": true,
      "extended_validity": "> 2 years",
      "cross_signed_certificates": true
    },
    "blocking_conditions": {
      "certificate_compromised": true,
      "ca_not_available": true,
      "policy_violations": true,
      "pending_security_review": true
    }
  },
  "renewal_strategies": {
    "early_renewal": "Renew 30-60 days before expiration",
    "just_in_time": "Renew 7-14 days before expiration",
    "emergency_renewal": "Renew < 7 days before expiration",
    "proactive_renewal": "Renew based on usage patterns"
  }

Then implement approval workflows:
  | Approval Type        | Workflow Process                       |
  | Standard approval   | Single approver for routine renewals   |
  | High-risk approval  | Multi-person approval for critical certs|

```

### Scenario: Renewal Failure Handling and Recovery
```gherkin
Given renewal operations may fail
When renewal failures occur
Then implement comprehensive failure handling:
  | Failure Type         | Recovery Strategy                      |
  | Generation failure  | Retry with backoff, escalate if persistent|
  | Deployment failure  | Automatic rollback to previous certificate|
  | Validation failure  | Hold deployment, alert administrators  |
  | Service disruption  | Emergency rollback, incident response  |
  | Partial failure     | Complete successful nodes, retry failed |
And provide failure recovery:
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff

  - Manual intervention procedures
  - Incident escalation workflows
  - Post-incident analysis and improvement
```

### Scenario: Renewal Coordination and Dependencies
```gherkin
Given certificates may have complex dependencies
When coordinating renewal across dependencies
Then implement dependency management:
  | Dependency Type      | Coordination Strategy                  |
  | Certificate chains  | Renew in proper order (leaf to root)   |
  | Cross-signed certs  | Coordinate with external CAs           |

  | Success rates       | Renewal success/failure rates by type  |
  | Performance         | Renewal duration, resource usage       |
  | Business impact     | Service disruption minutes saved       |
  | Cost Optimisation   | Renewal automation ROI                 |

  - Blue-green deployment coordination
  - Canary deployment support
```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: CA Unavailability During Renewal
```gherkin
Given certificate authorities may be unavailable
When CA is unavailable during renewal
Then:
  - Implement CA failover procedures
  - Queue renewals for retry when CA available
  - Support alternative CA sources
  - Extend certificate validity if possible
  - Alert administrators of CA issues
```

### Edge Case: Renewal During System Maintenance
```gherkin
Given system maintenance may conflict with renewals
When maintenance windows overlap with renewals
Then:
  - Coordinate renewal and maintenance schedules
  - Support renewal postponement
  - Provide maintenance-aware scheduling
  - Enable emergency renewal during maintenance
  - Document maintenance impact on renewals
```

### Edge Case: Mass Renewal Scenarios
```gherkin
Given many certificates may need renewal simultaneously
When handling bulk renewal scenarios
Then:
  - Implement bulk renewal capabilities
  - Provide resource throttling
  - Support staged renewal rollouts
  - Monitor system performance during bulk operations
  - Enable emergency abort for bulk renewals
```

### Edge Case: Network Partitions and Split-Brain
```gherkin
Given distributed systems may experience network partitions
When network partitions occur during renewal
Then:
  - Implement consensus protocols for renewal decisions
  - Support partial renewal completion
  - Provide network partition detection
  - Enable manual resolution of split-brain scenarios
  - Maintain renewal state consistency
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given automated renewal involves sensitive operations
Then implement comprehensive security:
  | Security Control     | Implementation                         |
  | Renewal Authorisation| Strong authentication for renewal operations|
  | Audit logging       | Complete audit trail of all renewals   |
  | Secure key handling | Protect private keys during renewal     |
  | Access controls     | Role-based access to renewal functions |
  | Non-repudiation     | Cryptographic proof of renewal actions  |
  | Integrity protection| Verify renewal artifacts integrity     |
  | Secure communication| TLS encryption for all renewal operations|
  | Incident response   | Security incident procedures for renewals|
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given renewal automation must be efficient and scalable
Then meet these targets:
  | Performance Metric   | Target                                 |
  | Renewal processing  | < 5 minutes per certificate renewal     |
  | Bulk renewal        | 100+ certificates per hour             |
  | System availability | 99.9% availability during renewals     |
  | Resource efficiency | < 10% CPU/memory during renewal ops    |
  | Network efficiency  | < 100MB data transfer per renewal      |
  | Storage efficiency  | < 50MB storage per renewal operation    |
```

## Integration Examples

### Renewal Policy Configuration
```yaml
renewal_policies:
  - name: "production_servers"
    conditions:
      certificate_type: "server"
      environment: "production"
    rules:
      automatic_renewal: true
      renewal_window: "30-60_days"
      maintenance_window_required: true
      approval_required: false
    
  - name: "ca_certificates"
    conditions:
      certificate_type: "ca"
    rules:
      automatic_renewal: false
      approval_required: true
      approvers: ["security_team", "ca_manager"]
```

### Renewal Workflow
