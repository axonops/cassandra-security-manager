# User Story 07.1 - Push-Based Certificate Deployment

## User Story
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** automated push-based certificate deployment to Cassandra nodes  
**So that** certificate updates happen securely and reliably without manual intervention

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Deployment can be developed separately from certificate generation
- **Negotiable**: Deployment methods and strategies are configurable
- **Valuable**: Eliminates manual deployment errors and reduces operational overhead
- **Estimable**: 3 sprints for complete automated deployment system
- **Small**: Focused on deployment automation only
- **Testable**: Deployment success and failure scenarios are verifiable

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: SSH-Based Secure Deployment
```gherkin
Given certificates need deployment to remote Cassandra nodes
When initiating automated deployment
Then use SSH for secure transfer:
{
  "deployment_config": {
    "connection": {
      "protocol": "SSH",
      "port": 22,
      "key_based_auth": true,
      "connection_timeout": 30,
      "command_timeout": 300
    },
    "transfer_method": "SCP",
    "backup_strategy": "CREATE_BACKUP_BEFORE_REPLACE",
    "verification_required": true,
    "rollback_on_failure": true
  },
  "security_measures": {
    "host_key_verification": "STRICT",
    "privilege_escalation": "SUDO_ONLY_WHEN_NEEDED",
    "file_permissions": "600_FOR_KEYS_644_FOR_CERTS",
    "ownership": "cassandra:cassandra",
    "selinux_context": "PRESERVE_EXISTING"
  }
}
And implement connection security:
  - Use dedicated deployment SSH keys
  - Rotate SSH keys regularly
  - Limit deployment user privileges
  - Log all deployment activities
  - Verify target node authenticity
```

### Scenario: Multi-Platform Deployment Support
```gherkin
Given Cassandra runs on various operating systems
When deploying to different platforms
Then support platform-specific operations:
  | Platform           | Certificate Path              | Service Management           |
  | Ubuntu/Debian     | /etc/cassandra/conf           | systemctl restart cassandra |
  | RHEL/CentOS       | /etc/cassandra/default.conf   | systemctl restart cassandra |
  | Windows Server    | C:\Program Files\Cassandra\conf| Restart-Service Cassandra   |
  | Docker Container  | /opt/cassandra/conf           | Container restart            |
  | Kubernetes Pod    | ConfigMap/Secret update       | Rolling update               |
And handle platform differences:
  - File path conventions
  - Permission models
  - Service management commands
  - Environment variables
  - Configuration file formats
```

### Scenario: Orchestration Integration
```gherkin
Given deployments need coordination across multiple nodes
When using orchestration tools
Then integrate with automation platforms:
  | Tool              | Integration Method                      |
  | Ansible          | Custom Ansible modules and playbooks    |
  | Salt             | Salt states and execution modules       |
  | Puppet           | Custom Puppet modules and manifests     |
  | Chef             | Chef cookbooks and recipes              |
  | Terraform        | Terraform providers for deployment      |
  | Kubernetes       | Operators and custom controllers        |
And provide deployment orchestration:
  - Parallel deployment coordination
  - Dependency management between nodes
  - Rolling deployment strategies
  - Cluster-aware deployment ordering
  - Integration with existing automation
```

### Scenario: Rolling Deployment Strategies
```gherkin
Given deployments must Minimise service disruption
When deploying to cluster environments
Then implement rolling deployment:
  | Strategy Type      | Implementation                          |
  | Blue-Green        | Deploy to inactive nodes, then switch   |
  | Canary            | Deploy to subset, verify, then continue |
  | Rolling Update    | Sequential deployment with health checks |
  | Zone-aware        | Deploy by availability zones            |
  | Load-aware        | Deploy based on current node load       |
And ensure high availability:
  - Maintain quorum during deployment
  - Respect replication requirements
  - Monitor cluster health continuously
  - Abort deployment on cluster instability
  - Provide deployment progress visibility
```

### Scenario: Container and Cloud Deployment
```gherkin
Given modern deployments use containers and cloud platforms
When deploying to containerized environments
Then support cloud-native deployment:
  | Environment        | Deployment Method                       |
  | Docker Swarm      | Service update with certificate secrets  |
  | Kubernetes        | ConfigMap/Secret updates with rolling restart|
  | AWS ECS           | Service update with new task definition  |
  | Azure Container   | Container group update                  |
  | Google Cloud Run  | Service revision with new certificates   |
And implement cloud integration:
  - Cloud provider API integration
  - Native secret management
  - Auto-scaling aware deployment
  - Cloud monitoring integration
  - Multi-region deployment coordination
```

### Scenario: Pre-Deployment Validation
```gherkin
Given invalid certificates cause service disruption
When preparing for deployment
Then validate before deployment:
  | Validation Check     | Implementation                         |
  | Certificate validity | Verify not expired and properly signed |
  | Chain completeness   | Ensure full certificate chain present  |
  | Key compatibility    | Verify private key matches certificate |
  | Target reachability  | Confirm deployment targets accessible  |
  | Disk space          | Verify sufficient space for new files  |
  | Service status      | Check service health before deployment |
  | Backup availability | Ensure backup can be created           |
And implement validation gates:
  - Block deployment on validation failure
  - Provide detailed validation reports
  - Support validation override with approval
  - Log all validation decisions
  - Integration with approval workflows
```

### Scenario: Deployment Progress Tracking
```gherkin
Given deployments need monitoring and visibility
When deployment is in progress
Then provide comprehensive tracking:
  | Tracking Element    | Information Provided                   |
  | Overall progress   | Percentage complete, ETA, status        |
  | Node-level status  | Per-node deployment status and logs     |
  | Phase tracking     | Current deployment phase and next steps |
  | Error reporting    | Detailed error messages and remediation |
  | Performance metrics| Deployment speed and resource usage     |
And implement real-time updates:
  - WebSocket updates for UI
  - API endpoints for progress queries
  - Webhook notifications for status changes
  - Integration with monitoring systems
  - Mobile-friendly progress views
```

### Scenario: Batch and Bulk Operations
```gherkin
Given large-scale deployments need efficiency
When deploying to many nodes simultaneously
Then support bulk operations:
  | Bulk Feature        | Implementation                         |
  | Parallel deployment| Deploy to multiple nodes concurrently  |
  | Batch sizing       | Configurable batch sizes for safety    |
  | Resource throttling| Limit resource usage during bulk ops   |
  | Progress aggregation| Combined progress view for bulk ops    |
  | Failure isolation | Continue deployment despite node failures|
And Optimise for scale:
  - Connection pooling for SSH connections
  - Parallel file transfers
  - Efficient progress reporting
  - Resource usage monitoring
  - Network bandwidth management
```

### Scenario: Deployment Scheduling
```gherkin
Given deployments need timing coordination
When scheduling deployments
Then provide scheduling capabilities:
  | Scheduling Feature  | Implementation                         |
  | Immediate deployment| Deploy as soon as validation passes     |
  | Scheduled deployment| Deploy at specific date/time           |
  | Maintenance window | Deploy only during maintenance windows  |
  | Recurring deployment| Regular deployment schedules           |
  | Conditional triggers| Deploy based on conditions             |
And integrate with operations:
  - Calendar integration for maintenance windows
  - Approval workflows for scheduled deployments
  - Automatic scheduling based on certificate expiration
  - Conflict detection with other operations
  - Emergency override capabilities
```

### Scenario: Agent vs Agentless Deployment
```gherkin
Given different environments have different constraints
When choosing deployment method
Then support both agent and agentless approaches:
  | Deployment Type     | Advantages                             |
  | Agentless (SSH)    | No agent installation, simple setup    |
  | Agent-based        | Better performance, real-time feedback |
  | Hybrid approach    | Mix based on environment requirements   |
And implement agent capabilities:
  - Lightweight deployment agent
  - Secure agent communication
  - Agent health monitoring
  - Agent auto-update capabilities
  - Fallback to agentless when agent unavailable
```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Network Connectivity Issues
```gherkin
Given network connectivity may be unreliable
When network issues occur during deployment
Then:
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Support resumable deployments
  - Provide deployment status persistence
  - Enable manual retry of failed nodes
  - Alert administrators of connectivity issues
```

### Edge Case: Partial Deployment Failures
```gherkin
Given some nodes may fail while others succeed
When partial deployment failures occur
Then:
  - Continue deployment to healthy nodes
  - Isolate failed nodes for investigation
  - Provide detailed failure analysis
  - Support manual remediation
  - Track deployment consistency across cluster
```

### Edge Case: Deployment During High Load
```gherkin
Given deployments may occur during high system load
When system resources are constrained
Then:
  - Monitor system load before deployment
  - Throttle deployment speed based on load
  - Respect system resource limits
  - Provide load-aware scheduling
  - Alert if deployment impacts performance
```

### Edge Case: Large Certificate Files
```gherkin
Given some certificates may be very large
When deploying large certificate files
Then:
  - Implement streaming transfer for large files
  - Provide transfer progress indicators
  - Support compressed transfer
  - Verify file integrity after transfer
  - Handle transfer timeouts gracefully
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given deployment involves sensitive certificate material
Then implement comprehensive security:
  | Security Control     | Implementation                         |
  | Secure transmission | TLS encryption for all communications   |
  | Authentication      | Multi-factor authentication for deployment|
  | Authorisation       | Role-based access to deployment functions|
  | Audit logging       | Complete audit trail of all operations |
  | Privilege separation| Least privilege for deployment operations|
  | Secret management   | Secure handling of deployment credentials|
  | Network security    | VPN/firewall restrictions for deployment |
  | Integrity protection| Digital signatures for all deployments |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given deployment performance affects service availability
Then meet these targets:
  | Performance Metric   | Target                                 |
  | Single node deployment| < 2 minutes per node                  |
  | Parallel deployment  | 10+ nodes simultaneously               |
  | Large cluster (100+) | < 30 minutes for full cluster         |
  | Network efficiency   | < 50% of available bandwidth usage     |
  | Resource impact      | < 10% CPU/memory impact on target nodes|
  | Recovery time        | < 5 minutes for deployment rollback    |
```
