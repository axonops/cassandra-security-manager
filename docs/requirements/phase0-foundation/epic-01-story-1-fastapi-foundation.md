# 01.1 - FastAPI Foundation

## User Story
**As a** system architect  
**I want** a robust API framework established  
**So that** all functionality can be exposed through well-documented, performant APIs

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: No dependencies on other stories
- **Negotiable**: Specific endpoint patterns can be refined
- **Valuable**: Provides foundation for all system interactions
- **Estimable**: 1-2 sprints
- **Small**: Focused on framework setup without business logic
- **Testable**: Clear technical requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: FastAPI Application Initialisation
```gherkin
Given I am setting up the application framework
When I initialise the FastAPI application
Then the system should implement RESTful endpoint patterns
And provide comprehensive OpenAPI documentation at /docs
And support both synchronous and asynchronous operations
And implement proper error handling and status codes
And include request ID tracking for all operations
```

### Scenario: Health Check Endpoint
```gherkin
Given the API is running
When I send a GET request to /health
Then I should receive a 200 OK response
And the response should include:
  | field         | type    | description                    |
  | status        | string  | "healthy" or "unhealthy"       |
  | version       | string  | Application version            |
  | timestamp     | string  | Current server time            |
  | dependencies  | object  | Status of dependent services   |
```

### Scenario: Request Validation
```gherkin
Given an API endpoint with defined request schema
When I send a request with invalid data
Then I should receive a 422 Unprocessable Entity response
And the response should contain detailed validation errors
And each error should specify the field and issue
```

### Scenario: Standardised Response Format
```gherkin
Given any API endpoint
When I make a successful request
Then the response should follow the standard structure:
  | field    | type    | description                         |
  | data     | object  | The requested resource or result    |
  | meta     | object  | Pagination, timing, version info    |
  | links    | object  | HATEOAS links for related actions   |
```

### Scenario: Error Response Format
```gherkin
Given any API endpoint
When an error occurs
Then the response should follow the error structure:
  | field         | type    | description                    |
  | error         | object  | Error details                  |
  | error.code    | string  | Machine-readable error code    |
  | error.message | string  | Human-readable error message   |
  | error.details | array   | Additional error context       |
  | error.request_id | string | Unique request identifier   |
```

### Scenario: API Versioning
```gherkin
Given multiple API versions need to be supported
When I include "Accept: application/vnd.axonops-security.v1+json" header
Then I should receive responses from API version 1
And deprecated endpoints should include a "Sunset" header
And the response should include deprecation warnings when applicable
```

### Scenario: Request Rate Limiting
```gherkin
Given the API needs to prevent abuse
When I make more than 100 requests per minute from a single IP
Then I should receive a 429 Too Many Requests response
And the response should include:
  | header                  | description                           |
  | X-RateLimit-Limit      | Maximum requests per window           |
  | X-RateLimit-Remaining  | Requests remaining in current window  |
  | X-RateLimit-Reset      | When the limit window resets          |
```

### Scenario: CORS Configuration
```gherkin
Given the API will be accessed from web applications
When I send an OPTIONS request from an allowed origin
Then I should receive appropriate CORS headers:
  | header                           | value                    |
  | Access-Control-Allow-Origin      | Configured origins       |
  | Access-Control-Allow-Methods     | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE   |
  | Access-Control-Allow-Headers     | Configured headers       |
  | Access-Control-Max-Age          | 86400                    |
```

## Technical Notes
- Use FastAPI 0.100+ for latest features
- Implement Pydantic v2 for performance improvements
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Consider implementing OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
- Ensure all datetime fields use ISO 8601 format
- Implement proper logging with correlation IDs
