# Phase 0 Epic 01: API Framework and Core Architecture

## Overview
The API-first approach requires establishing a robust foundation using FastAPI, implementing comprehensive request/response models, and creating OpenAPI/Swagger documentation. The architecture must support both synchronous operations for immediate responses and asynchronous operations for long-running tasks such as certificate generation.

## User Stories
1. **01.1 - FastAPI Foundation**: Establish robust API framework with well-documented, performant APIs
2. **01.2 - Asynchronous Task Processing**: Handle long-running operations asynchronously to maintain API responsiveness

## Dependencies
- None (foundational epic)

## Success Metrics
- API response time < 100ms for simple operations
- OpenAPI documentation automatically generated
- 100% of endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- Asynchronous tasks properly tracked and manageable
- Request ID tracking implemented for all operations

## Technical Considerations
- Use FastAPI with Pydantic for automatic validation
- Implement proper middleware for logging and error handling
- Use Celery with Redis for async task processing
- Ensure all endpoints are versioned from the start
- Consider GraphQL for complex query requirements
