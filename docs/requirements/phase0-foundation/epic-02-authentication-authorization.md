# Phase 0 Epic 02: Authentication, Authorisation, and User Management

## Overview
Security cannot be retrofitted into a security management tool. This epic establishes comprehensive authentication and authorisation mechanisms from the outset, including JWT-based authentication, LDAP integration, and role-based access control.

## User Stories
1. **A2.1 - JWT-Based Authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms for system access
2. **A2.2 - Role-Based Access Control**: Provide granular role-based permissions for different user types
3. **A2.3 - LDAP Integration**: Enable authentication using corporate LDAP credentials

## Dependencies
- A1 (API Framework) - Authentication middleware requires API framework

## Success Metrics
- Authentication response time < 200ms
- Support for 5 predefined roles + custom roles
- LDAP authentication working with major providers
- Token refresh mechanism preventing session interruption
- 100% of endpoints protected by authentication

## Technical Considerations
- Use PyJWT with RS256 algorithm for tokens
- Implement Redis for token blacklisting
- Use python-ldap3 for LDAP integration
- Consider OAuth2/OIDC for future SSO support
- Implement proper password hashing with argon2
- Rate limit authentication endpoints aggressively
