# 01.2 - Asynchronous Task Processing

## User Story
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** long-running operations to be handled asynchronously  
**So that** the API remains responsive during complex certificate operations

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Can be developed after A1.1
- **Negotiable**: Specific task queue implementation can be adjusted
- **Valuable**: Ensures system responsiveness for long operations
- **Estimable**: 1 sprint
- **Small**: Focused on async infrastructure
- **Testable**: Clear performance requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Asynchronous Task Submission
```gherkin
Given I initiate a long-running operation
When the API receives the request
Then it should return an immediate 202 Accepted response
And the response should include:
  | field         | type    | description                    |
  | task_id       | string  | Unique task identifier         |
  | status_url    | string  | URL to check task status       |
  | cancel_url    | string  | URL to cancel the task         |
  | estimated_time| integer | Estimated seconds to complete  |
```

### Scenario: Task Status Checking
```gherkin
Given I have a task_id from an async operation
When I GET /tasks/{task_id}
Then I should receive the current task status:
  | status    | description                              |
  | pending   | Task is queued but not started          |
  | running   | Task is currently executing             |
  | completed | Task finished successfully              |
  | failed    | Task failed with error                  |
  | cancelled | Task was cancelled by user              |
And completed tasks should include result data
And failed tasks should include error details
```

### Scenario: Task Progress Tracking
```gherkin
Given a long-running task is in progress
When I check the task status
Then I should see progress information:
  | field           | type    | description                    |
  | current_step    | string  | Current operation being performed |
  | total_steps     | integer | Total number of steps         |
  | percent_complete| integer | Percentage (0-100)            |
  | messages        | array   | Progress messages             |
```

### Scenario: Task Cancellation
```gherkin
Given a running or pending task
When I POST to /tasks/{task_id}/cancel
Then the task should be marked for cancellation
And running tasks should stop at the next safe point
And the final status should be "cancelled"
And any partial results should be cleaned up
```

### Scenario: Task History and Audit
```gherkin
Given completed tasks
When I GET /tasks with filters
Then I should be able to query by:
  | parameter     | description                    |
  | user_id       | Tasks created by specific user |
  | status        | Filter by task status          |
  | task_type     | Type of operation              |
  | created_after | Tasks created after date       |
  | created_before| Tasks created before date      |
And results should be paginated
And include summary information for each task
```

### Scenario: Task Queue Management
```gherkin
Given multiple tasks are submitted
When the system processes them
Then tasks should be processed in priority order
And high-priority tasks should preempt normal tasks
And the system should limit concurrent executions
And failed tasks should be retried with exponential backoff
```

### Scenario: Task Result Storage
```gherkin
Given a completed task
When I retrieve its results
Then results should be available for a configurable period
And large results should be stored efficiently
And results should be purged after retention period
And audit logs should be maintained permanently
```

### Scenario: Webhook Notifications
```gherkin
Given a task with webhook configuration
When the task completes or fails
Then the system should POST to the configured webhook URL
And include task results in the payload
And retry failed webhook calls
And log all webhook attempts
```

## Technical Notes
- Use Celery with Redis as message broker
- Implement Flower for task monitoring
- Store task results in Redis with TTL
- Use PostgreSQL for task history/audit
- Implement circuit breakers for external calls
- Consider using priority queues for different task types
- Ensure tasks are idempotent where possible
