# User Story 04.1 - API Security Hardening

## User Story
**As a** security architect  
**I want** comprehensive API security  
**So that** the system is protected against common attacks and vulnerabilities

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Can be implemented after API framework is established
- **Negotiable**: Specific security controls can be adjusted based on threat model
- **Valuable**: Critical for protecting the entire system
- **Estimable**: 2 sprints for comprehensive implementation
- **Small**: Focused on API-layer security controls
- **Testable**: Security tests can verify each control

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Input Validation Against Injection Attacks
```gherkin
Given an API endpoint accepting user input
When a request contains potentially malicious content
Then the system should detect and reject:
  | Attack Type          | Example                                    | Response |
  | SQL Injection       | '; DROP TABLE certificates; --             | 400      |
  | NoSQL Injection     | {"$ne": null}                             | 400      |
  | Command Injection   | ; cat /etc/passwd                         | 400      |
  | Path Traversal      | ../../etc/passwd                          | 400      |
  | XXE Injection       | <!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]> | 400 |
  | Template Injection  | {{7*7}}                                   | 400      |
And log the attack attempt with source IP and payload
And increment rate limit counter for the source
```

### Scenario: Rate Limiting by Endpoint and User
```gherkin
Given different endpoints have different sensitivity levels
When rate limits are configured
Then the following limits should apply:
  | Endpoint Pattern        | Anonymous | Authenticated | Admin    |
  | POST /auth/login       | 5/min     | N/A          | N/A      |
  | POST /certificates     | N/A       | 10/hour      | 100/hour |
  | GET /certificates      | N/A       | 100/min      | 1000/min |
  | POST /ca/root          | N/A       | N/A          | 1/day    |
  | GET /health           | 60/min    | 60/min       | 60/min   |
And rate limit headers should be included in responses
And limits should be enforced per IP and per user independently
```

### Scenario: Security Headers Implementation
```gherkin
Given modern browsers support security headers
When any API response is sent
Then the following headers must be included:
  | Header                          | Value                                      |
  | X-Content-Type-Options         | nosniff                                    |
  | X-Frame-Options                | DENY                                       |
  | X-XSS-Protection               | 1; mode=block                             |
  | Strict-Transport-Security      | max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains       |
  | Content-Security-Policy        | default-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none' |
  | Referrer-Policy                | strict-origin-when-cross-origin           |
  | Permissions-Policy             | geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()  |
And sensitive headers must be removed:
  | Header to Remove               | Reason                                     |
  | Server                        | Hide implementation details                |
  | X-Powered-By                  | Hide technology stack                      |
```

### Scenario: CORS Policy Enforcement
```gherkin
Given the API will be accessed from web applications
When CORS is configured with allowed origins
Then the system should:
  | Check                          | Action                                     |
  | Origin not in whitelist       | Reject with no CORS headers               |
  | Origin in whitelist           | Add appropriate CORS headers               |
  | Credentials requested         | Verify origin explicitly allowed           |
  | Custom headers used           | Validate against allowed headers           |
And preflight requests should be cached for 24 hours
And only specific origins should be allowed, never "*"
```

### Scenario: Request Size and Timeout Limits
```gherkin
Given large requests can cause resource exhaustion
When requests are processed
Then the following limits should apply:
  | Limit Type                     | Value    | Action on Exceed           |
  | Request body size             | 10MB     | 413 Payload Too Large      |
  | JSON nesting depth            | 10       | 400 Bad Request            |
  | Array item count              | 1000     | 400 Bad Request            |
  | String field length           | 10000    | 422 Validation Error       |
  | Request timeout               | 30s      | 504 Gateway Timeout        |
  | Multipart file size           | 50MB     | 413 Payload Too Large      |
```

### Scenario: SQL/NoSQL Injection Prevention
```gherkin
Given database queries are constructed from user input
When executing any database operation
Then the system must:
  | Protection                     | Implementation                             |
  | Use prepared statements       | All queries use parameter binding          |
  | Validate data types           | Strict type checking before queries        |
  | Escape special characters     | Context-aware escaping                     |
  | Limit query complexity        | Prevent deep nesting or joins              |
  | Monitor query patterns        | Detect anomalous query structures          |
And never concatenate user input into queries
And log all query construction errors
```

### Scenario: API Versioning Security
```gherkin
Given multiple API versions may exist
When deprecated versions are accessed
Then the system should:
  | Version Status  | Response                                            |
  | Current (v1)    | Normal processing                                   |
  | Deprecated      | Add "Sunset" header with deprecation date          |
  | Obsolete        | 410 Gone with migration instructions                |
  | Unknown         | 404 Not Found                                       |
And security patches must be backported to all supported versions
And version-specific vulnerabilities must be tracked
```

### Scenario: Error Message Security
```gherkin
Given error messages can leak sensitive information
When an error occurs
Then the response must:
  | Error Type                | External Message            | Internal Log              |
  | Database connection      | "Service unavailable"       | Full connection details   |
  | Authentication failure   | "Invalid credentials"       | Specific failure reason   |
  | File not found          | "Resource not found"        | Full file path           |
  | Permission denied       | "Insufficient privileges"    | Required vs actual perms  |
  | Validation error        | Specific field errors       | Full validation context   |
And never expose:
  - Stack traces
  - Internal server paths
  - Database schema information
  - Third-party service details
```

### Scenario: Security Event Monitoring
```gherkin
Given security events need real-time detection
When suspicious activity occurs
Then the system should:
  | Event Type                    | Action                      | Alert Level |
  | Multiple failed logins       | Increment counter, alert    | Medium      |
  | Injection attempt detected   | Block, log, alert          | High        |
  | Unusual API usage pattern    | Log, Analyse, alert        | Low         |
  | Privilege escalation attempt | Block, log, alert, lock    | Critical    |
  | Data exfiltration pattern    | Rate limit, log, alert     | High        |
And integrate with SIEM systems via:
  - Syslog forwarding
  - Webhook notifications
  - API polling endpoints
```

### Scenario: API Key Security
```gherkin
Given API keys provide programmatic access
When API keys are used
Then the system must:
  | Security Control             | Implementation                               |
  | Key format                  | Cryptographically random, 32+ characters     |
  | Key transmission            | HTTPS only, never in URL                     |
  | Key storage                 | Hashed with salt, never plaintext           |
  | Key rotation                | Support multiple active keys                 |
  | Key revocation              | Immediate effect, audit logged               |
  | Key scoping                 | Limit permissions per key                    |
And detect compromised keys through:
  - Geographic anomaly detection
  - Concurrent usage from multiple IPs
  - Unusual request patterns
```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Distributed Brute Force
```gherkin
Given attackers may use distributed IPs
When multiple IPs attempt similar attacks
Then the system should:
  - Detect patterns across IPs (same user agent, timing, payloads)
  - Implement global rate limits for sensitive operations
  - Use CAPTCHA or proof-of-work for repeated failures
  - Temporarily block entire IP ranges if necessary
```

### Edge Case: Legitimate High-Volume Usage
```gherkin
Given some legitimate uses require high request rates
When a known integration needs higher limits
Then the system should:
  - Support API key-specific rate limits
  - Implement burst allowances
  - Provide advance notice of limit changes
  - Offer webhook alternatives for polling scenarios
```

### Edge Case: Zero-Day Vulnerability Response
```gherkin
Given new vulnerabilities may be discovered
When a security issue is identified
Then the system must support:
  - Emergency security header injection
  - Rapid rule deployment without restart
  - Selective endpoint disabling
  - Request replay for forensics
```

## Technical Notes
- Implement security controls as middleware layers
- Use Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules where available
- Consider implementing RASP (Runtime Application Security Protection)
- Monitor OWASP Top 10 and adjust controls accordingly
- Implement security.txt file for responsible disclosure
- Use structured logging for security events
- Consider implementing API behaviour analytics
