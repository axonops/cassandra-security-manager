## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Data Quality Issues
```gherkin
Given data quality affects dashboard accuracy
When data quality issues occur
Then:
  - Show data quality indicators
  - Flag incomplete data sets
  - Provide confidence scores
  - Show data lineage
  - Allow manual corrections
```

### Edge Case: Performance with Large Datasets
```gherkin
Given dashboards must handle big data
When processing large volumes
Then:
  - Implement data aggregation
  - Use sampling for real-time views
  - Provide progressive loading
  - Cache computed metrics
  - Optimise query performance
```

### Edge Case: Multi-Region Data Consolidation
```gherkin
Given global Organisations have distributed data
When consolidating multi-region data
Then:
  - Handle timezone conversions
  - Aggregate with latency consideration
  - Show region-specific views
  - Handle currency conversions
  - Respect data residency requirements
```

### Edge Case: Executive Access Patterns
```gherkin
Given executives have limited time
When Optimising for executive use
Then:
  - Prioritize critical metrics
  - Provide executive summaries
  - Enable quick navigation
  - Support delegation views
  - Offer scheduled reports
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given executive dashboards contain sensitive data
Then implement comprehensive security:
  | Security Control     | Implementation                         |
  | Access control      | Role-based executive access            |
  | Data encryption     | Encrypt data at rest and in transit    |
  | Audit logging       | Log all dashboard access               |
  | Session security    | Short session timeouts                 |
  | Export controls     | Watermark and track exports            |
  | Network security    | VPN/zero-trust access required         |
  | Data masking        | Mask sensitive data in screenshots     |
  | MFA requirement     | Enforce multi-factor authentication    |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given executives expect instant insights
Then meet these performance targets:
  | Performance Metric   | Target                                 |
  | Dashboard load time | < 2 seconds initial load               |
  | Data refresh rate   | < 1 minute for real-time data          |
  | Report generation   | < 5 seconds for standard reports       |
  | Query response time | < 500ms for drill-down queries         |
  | Mobile performance  | < 3 seconds on 4G networks             |
  | Concurrent users    | Support 100+ simultaneous executives   |
```
