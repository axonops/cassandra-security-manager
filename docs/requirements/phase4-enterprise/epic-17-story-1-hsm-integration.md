# 17.1 - Hardware Security Module Integration

## User Story
**As a** security architect  
**I want** HSM integration for cryptographic operations  
**So that** private keys are protected by FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified hardware

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: HSM integration can be developed separately from core features
- **Negotiable**: HSM vendors and integration methods are configurable
- **Valuable**: Provides regulatory compliance and enhanced key protection
- **Estimable**: 3 sprints for comprehensive HSM integration
- **Small**: Focused on HSM cryptographic operations only
- **Testable**: HSM operations and performance are measurable

## Acceptance Criteria

```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: HSM Connection Loss
```gherkin
Given network connectivity may be interrupted
When HSM connection is lost
Then:
  - Queue operations for retry
  - Failover to standby HSM
  - Alert operations team
  - Prevent key generation fallback to software
  - Maintain operation audit trail
```

### Edge Case: HSM Performance Degradation
```gherkin
Given HSMs may experience performance issues
When performance degrades
Then:
  - Implement circuit breakers
  - Route to less loaded HSMs
  - Enable operation queuing
  - Alert on SLA violations
  - Provide performance metrics
```

### Edge Case: HSM Capacity Limits
```gherkin
Given HSMs have finite key storage
When approaching capacity limits
Then:
  - Monitor key slot usage
  - Implement key rotation policies
  - Archive unused keys
  - Alert before capacity reached
  - Plan capacity expansion
```

### Edge Case: HSM Firmware Updates
```gherkin
Given HSMs require firmware updates
When updates are needed
Then:
  - Plan maintenance windows
  - Ensure key backup before update
  - Test in non-production first
  - Implement rollback procedures
  - Document update procedures
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given HSMs are critical security infrastructure
Then implement comprehensive security:
  | Security Control     | Implementation                         |
  | Network security    | Dedicated HSM network segment          |
  | Access control      | Multi-factor authentication            |
  | API security        | Mutual TLS for HSM communication       |
  | Key protection      | Hardware-enforced non-extractable      |
  | Audit logging       | Tamper-proof HSM audit logs           |
  | Physical security   | Data Centre security controls          |
  | Firmware integrity  | Signed firmware verification           |
  | Emergency access    | Break-glass procedures with audit      |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given HSM operations must meet performance targets
Then achieve these metrics:
  | Performance Metric   | Target                                 |
  | Key generation      | < 2 seconds for RSA-4096               |
  | Signing operation   | < 100ms per signature                  |
  | Bulk signing        | > 1000 signatures per second           |
  | Connection setup    | < 500ms initial connection             |
  | Failover time       | < 1 second to standby HSM              |
  | Availability        | 99.99% HSM service availability        |
```
