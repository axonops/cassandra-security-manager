# 19.1 - Regional CA Deployment

## User Story
**As a** global security architect  
**I want** certificate authorities deployed across geographic regions  
**So that** we meet data sovereignty requirements and Optimise performance globally

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Regional deployment can be developed separately from core CA features
- **Negotiable**: Regional architecture and boundaries are configurable
- **Valuable**: Enables global operations with local compliance
- **Estimable**: 4 sprints for comprehensive regional deployment
- **Small**: Focused on regional CA infrastructure only
- **Testable**: Regional performance and compliance are measurable

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Multi-Region CA Architecture
```gherkin
Given Organisations operate globally
When deploying regional CAs
Then implement hierarchical architecture:
{
  "global_pki_hierarchy": {
    "global_root_ca": {
      "location": "secure_offline_facility",
      "purpose": "root_of_trust",
      "certificate_validity": "20_years",
      "key_ceremony": "multi_person_control",
      "usage": "sign_regional_cas_only"
    },
    "regional_intermediate_cas": {
      "north_america": {
        "locations": ["us-east", "us-west", "canada"],
        "compliance": ["SOX", "HIPAA", "PIPEDA"],
        "data_residency": "north_america_only"
      },
      "europe": {
        "locations": ["eu-central", "eu-west", "eu-north"],
        "compliance": ["GDPR", "eIDAS", "NIS2"],
        "data_residency": "eu_only"
      },
      "asia_pacific": {
        "locations": ["apac-east", "apac-south", "australia"],
        "compliance": ["PDPA", "Privacy_Act", "Cybersecurity_Law"],
        "data_residency": "apac_only"
      },
      "latin_america": {
        "locations": ["brazil", "mexico", "argentina"],
        "compliance": ["LGPD", "LFPDPPP", "Data_Protection_Law"],
        "data_residency": "latam_only"
      }
    },
    "issuing_cas": {
      "per_region": true,
      "per_environment": ["production", "staging", "development"],
      "certificate_validity": "1-3_years",
      "automated_renewal": true
    }
  }
}
And enforce hierarchy:
  - Regional CAs can only issue within region
  - Cross-signing for global trust
  - Offline root CA activation
  - Regional autonomy with global oversight
  - Compliance boundary enforcement
```

### Scenario: Data Sovereignty and Residency
```gherkin
Given different regions have data residency laws
When managing certificate data
Then enforce data sovereignty:
  | Region               | Data Residency Requirements            |
  | European Union      | All data must remain in EU             |
  | China               | Data cannot leave mainland China       |
  | Russia              | Personal data must stay in Russia      |
  | Switzerland         | Financial data requires Swiss storage  |
  | Canada              | Government data stays in Canada        |
And implement controls:
  - Geographic data tagging
  - Cross-border transfer blocking
  - Regional data encryption keys
  - Audit trail localization
  - Compliance attestation per region
```

### Scenario: Regional Performance Optimisation
```gherkin
Given latency affects user experience
When Optimising regional performance
Then implement performance features:
  | Optimisation         | Implementation                         |
  | Edge locations      | CA services at network edge            |

And achieve targets:
  - < 50ms certificate operations in-region
  - < 200ms cross-region metadata sync
  - 99.9% regional availability
  - Automatic failover within region
  - Load balancing across zones
```

### Scenario: Cross-Region Synchronisation
```gherkin
Given some data needs global visibility
When Synchronising across regions
Then implement selective sync:
  | Data Type            | Sync Strategy                          |
  | Certificate metadata| Real-time replication                  |
  | Revocation status   | Immediate global propagation           |
  | Policy updates      | Controlled rollout per region          |
  | Audit logs          | Regional storage, global search        |
  | Compliance status   | Aggregated without raw data            |
And ensure consistency:
  - Eventual consistency model

```

### Scenario: Regional Disaster Recovery
```gherkin
Given each region needs disaster recovery
When implementing DR strategies
Then provide regional DR:
  | DR Component         | Regional Implementation                |
  | Backup sites        | Secondary site within region           |
  | Data replication    | Intra-region replication only          |
  | Failover strategy   | Regional automatic failover            |
  | Recovery time       | < 15 minutes RTO within region         |
  | Recovery point      | < 5 minutes RPO for regional data      |
And ensure:
  - No cross-region data leakage during DR
  - Regional DR testing procedures
  - Compliance maintenance during DR
  - Regional runbooks
  - Stakeholder communication plans
```

### Scenario: Regional Certificate Templates
```gherkin
Given different regions have different certificate needs
When managing certificate templates
Then support regional templates:
  | Template Type        | Regional Variations                    |
  | Naming conventions  | Local domain and naming rules          |
  | Key algorithms      | Region-approved algorithms only        |
  | Validity periods    | Regional maximum validity              |

  - Template compliance validation
  - Cross-region template sharing controls
```

### Scenario: Regional API Endpoints
```gherkin
Given applications need low-latency access
When providing API access
Then deploy regional endpoints:
  | API Feature          | Regional Implementation                |
  | Endpoint URLs       | region.api.certmanager.com            |
  | Authentication      | Regional auth servers                  |
  | Rate limiting       | Per-region rate limits                 |
  | API versioning      | Region-specific API versions           |
  | Documentation       | Localized API documentation            |
And Optimise:
  - GeoDNS routing
  - Regional API gateways
  - Edge API caching
  - Regional API monitoring
  - Latency-based routing
```

### Scenario: Global Certificate Intelligence
```gherkin
Given global visibility is needed for security
When aggregating regional data
Then provide global intelligence:
  | Intelligence Type    | Aggregation Method                     |
  | Certificate inventory| Federated search across regions       |
  | Security metrics    | Anonymized metric aggregation          |
  | Compliance posture  | Regional score rollup                  |
  | Threat intelligence | Global threat correlation              |
  | Operational metrics | Performance aggregation                |
And maintain privacy:
  - No PII in global views
  - Regional data anonymization
  - Aggregated statistics only
  - Role-based global access
  - Audit trail for global queries
```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Cross-Region Certificate Requirements
```gherkin
Given some certificates need multi-region validity
When handling cross-region certificates
Then:
  - Support multi-region SANs
  - Implement approval from all regions
  - Ensure compliance in all regions
  - Track multi-region usage
  - Handle region-specific revocation
```

### Edge Case: Regional Network Partitions
```gherkin
Given regions may be isolated
When network partitions occur
Then:
  - Continue regional operations independently
  - Queue cross-region updates
  - Prevent split-brain scenarios
  - Reconcile when connectivity returns
  - Maintain audit continuity
```

### Edge Case: Regulatory Conflicts
```gherkin
Given regulations may conflict between regions
When conflicts arise
Then:
  - Apply most restrictive requirement
  - Document conflict resolution
  - Provide compliance rationale
  - Support exception workflows
  - Maintain audit trail
```

### Edge Case: Regional Capacity Limits
```gherkin
Given regions have different scales
When approaching capacity
Then:
  - Implement regional auto-scaling
  - Provide capacity warnings
  - Support cross-region overflow (compliant)
  - Plan capacity by region
  - Monitor growth trends
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given regional deployment increases attack surface
Then implement comprehensive security:
  | Security Control     | Implementation                         |
  | Network isolation   | Regional security perimeters           |
  | Access control      | Regional RBAC with global oversight    |
  | Encryption          | Regional encryption keys               |
  | Key management      | Regional HSMs with global root         |
  | Audit logging       | Regional audit with global correlation |
  | Threat detection    | Regional SOCs with global intelligence |
  | Incident response   | Regional teams with global coordination|
  | Compliance monitoring| Continuous regional compliance checks  |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given global operations require consistent performance
Then meet these regional targets:
  | Performance Metric   | Target                                 |
  | In-region latency   | < 50ms for certificate operations      |
  | Cross-region sync   | < 5 minutes for metadata               |
  | Regional availability| 99.9% per region                      |
  | Failover time       | < 30 seconds within region             |
  | API response time   | < 100ms for regional endpoints         |
  | Throughput          | 10,000+ certs/hour per region         |
```
