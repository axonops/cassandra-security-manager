# User Story 08.1 - Administrative Web Interface

## User Story
**As an** administrator  
**I want** a comprehensive web interface for certificate management  
**So that** I can efficiently manage the certificate infrastructure without command-line tools

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: UI can be developed separately from backend APIs
- **Negotiable**: Interface design and workflows can be adjusted
- **Valuable**: Provides accessibility for non-technical users
- **Estimable**: 3 sprints for complete administrative interface
- **Small**: Focused on admin operations only
- **Testable**: All functions can be validated through UI automation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Administrator Dashboard Overview
```gherkin
Given I am an authenticated administrator
When I access the main dashboard
Then I should see:
  | Widget                    | Data Displayed                           |
  | Certificate Overview     | Total active, expiring, revoked         |
  | CA Hierarchy Status      | Root CA, subordinate CAs, health        |
  | Recent Activity         | Last 10 certificate operations          |
  | System Health           | API status, database connectivity       |
  | Security Alerts         | Policy violations, suspicious activity  |
  | Performance Metrics     | Response times, throughput, errors      |
And all widgets should update in real-time via WebSocket
And provide drill-down capabilities to detailed views
```

### Scenario: Certificate Authority Management
```gherkin
Given I need to manage the CA hierarchy
When I access the CA management section
Then I can perform these operations:
  | Operation               | Interface Elements                       |
  | View CA hierarchy      | Tree view with status indicators         |

Given administrators may use mobile devices
When accessing the interface on mobile/tablet
Then the interface should:
  | Mobile Feature          | Implementation                          |
  | Responsive layout      | Adaptive design for all screen sizes    |
  | Touch-friendly controls| Large buttons, swipe gestures           |

And maintain security controls on mobile
And provide native app-like experience
```

### Scenario: Real-time Updates and Notifications
```gherkin
Given operations happen in real-time
When system events occur
Then the interface should:
  | Event Type              | Notification Method                     |
  | Certificate generated  | Toast notification with details         |

  | Security event         | Prominent alert with investigation link |
  | Schedule maintenance   | Banner notification with countdown      |
And support WebSocket connections for real-time updates
And provide notification preferences per user
```

### Scenario: Accessibility and Internationalization
```gherkin
Given the interface must be accessible to all users
When designing the interface
Then implement:
  | Accessibility Feature   | Implementation                          |
  | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance| Proper contrast, alt text, keyboard nav |
  | Screen reader support  | ARIA labels, semantic HTML             |
  | Keyboard navigation    | Tab order, shortcuts, focus indicators |
  | High contrast mode     | Alternative Colour scheme               |

  | Language support       | Multi-language interface (i18n)        |
  | RTL language support   | Right-to-left text direction           |
  | Voice commands         | Basic voice navigation support         |
And test with assistive technologies
And provide accessibility documentation
```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Session Management
```gherkin
Given sessions can timeout or be compromised
When session issues occur
Then:
  - Graceful session timeout with warning
  - Automatic logout on security events
  - Session token refresh without interruption
  - Multiple session detection and management
  - Device fingerprinting for security
```

### Edge Case: Large Dataset Performance
```gherkin
Given large certificate databases exist
When displaying large result sets
Then:
  - Implement pagination with configurable page size
  - Use virtual scrolling for performance
  - Provide bulk operation progress indicators
  - Cache frequently accessed data
  - Optimise database queries for UI operations
```

### Edge Case: Network Connectivity Issues
```gherkin
Given network connections may be unreliable
When connectivity is poor
Then:
  - Show connection status indicators
  - Cache essential data locally
  - Provide offline mode for read operations
  - Queue operations for retry when reconnected
  - Graceful degradation of features
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given the web interface is a potential attack vector
Then implement security controls:
  | Security Control        | Implementation                          |
  | Content Security Policy| Strict CSP headers to prevent XSS       |
  | CSRF protection        | Anti-CSRF tokens for state changes      |
  | Input validation       | Client and server-side validation       |
  | Output encoding        | Prevent injection attacks               |
  | Secure headers         | HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.            |
  | Rate limiting          | Per-user rate limits on operations      |
  | Audit logging          | Log all administrative actions          |
  | Session security       | Secure cookies, session fixation protection |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given performance affects user experience
Then meet these targets:
  | Performance Metric      | Target                                  |
  | Page load time         | < 2 seconds initial load                |
  | API response time      | < 500ms for UI operations              |
  | Search results         | < 1 second for 10,000 certificates     |
  | Real-time updates      | < 100ms latency for WebSocket events   |
  | Bulk operations        | Progress updates every 100ms           |
  | Mobile performance     | < 3 seconds on 3G networks             |
```
