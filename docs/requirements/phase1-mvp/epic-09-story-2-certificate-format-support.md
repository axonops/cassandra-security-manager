- **Negotiable**: Specific formats and conversion options are configurable
- **Valuable**: Enables integration with legacy and modern systems
- **Estimable**: 2 sprints for comprehensive format support
- **Small**: Focused on format conversion and export only
- **Testable**: Format conversion accuracy can be validated

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Standard Certificate Formats
```gherkin
Given different systems require different certificate formats
When exporting certificates
Then support these standard formats:
  | Format              | Extension  | Use Case                               |
  | PEM                | .pem, .crt | Unix/Linux systems, web servers        |
  | DER                | .der, .cer | Windows systems, binary format          |
  | PKCS#7             | .p7b, .p7c | Certificate chains, message signing     |
  | PKCS#12            | .p12, .pfx | Windows, includes private key           |
  | JKS                | .jks       | Java applications, Cassandra           |
  | JCEKS              | .jceks     | Java, stronger encryption              |
  | OpenSSH            | .pub       | SSH public key format                   |
  | SSH Certificate    | -cert.pub  | SSH certificate format                  |
And validate format conversion accuracy:
  - Preserve all certificate extensions
  - Maintain certificate chain order
  - Verify digital signatures after conversion
  - Ensure private key protection
```

  | Expiration validation | No expired certificates in active chain |
  | Key usage validation  | Certificate purposes match usage         |
  | Extension validation  | Critical extensions properly handled     |
And provide chain diagnostics:
  - Chain visualization
  - Missing certificate detection
  - Alternative chain options
  - Trust anchor verification
  - Path validation results
```

### Scenario: Format Conversion Security
```gherkin
Given format conversion can introduce vulnerabilities
When converting between formats
Then maintain security:
  | Security Aspect        | Protection Measures                     |
  | Private key protection| Never expose keys in insecure formats   |
  | Password protection   | Strong passwords for encrypted formats  |
  | Temporary file cleanup| Secure deletion of conversion artifacts |
  | Memory protection     | Clear sensitive data from memory        |
  | Audit trail          | Log all format conversion operations    |
  | Format validation    | Verify output format integrity          |
And implement secure conversion:
  - Use secure random for passwords
  - Implement secure file handling
  - Validate input format before conversion
  - Check output format after conversion
  - Use constant-time operations where possible
```

### Scenario: Bulk Export and Import
```gherkin
Given large-scale operations need bulk processing
When processing multiple certificates
Then support bulk operations:
  | Bulk Operation         | Implementation                          |
  | Export all certificates| ZIP archive with manifest               |
  | Export by filter      | Query-based bulk export                 |
  | Format conversion     | Batch convert to different formats      |
  | Import validation     | Validate all certificates before import |
  | Progress tracking     | Real-time progress for large batches    |
  | Error reporting       | Detailed error reports for failures     |
And Optimise for performance:
  - Parallel processing
  - Streaming for large datasets
  - Memory-efficient processing
  - Resume capability for interrupted operations
  - Compression for large exports
```

### Scenario: Custom Format Support
```gherkin
Given Organisations may have custom format requirements
When supporting custom formats
Then provide extensibility:
  | Extensibility Feature  | Implementation                          |
  | Plugin architecture   | Custom format converters                |
  | Template system       | User-defined output templates           |
  | Script integration    | Custom conversion scripts               |
  | API hooks             | Pre/post conversion webhooks            |
  | Format validation     | Custom validation rules                 |
And provide development tools:
  - Format converter SDK
  - Template documentation
  - Validation framework
  - Testing utilities
  - Example implementations
```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Large Certificate Chains
```gherkin
Given some certificate chains are very large
When processing large chains
Then:
  - Stream processing for memory efficiency
  - Progress indicators for user feedback
  - Timeout handling for long operations
  - Chunked download for large files
  - Compression to reduce transfer size
```

### Edge Case: Corrupted Certificate Data
```gherkin
Given certificates may be corrupted
When detecting corruption
Then:
  - Validate certificate before conversion
  - Provide detailed error messages
  - Attempt recovery when possible
  - Log corruption incidents
  - Notify administrators of data issues
```

### Edge Case: Unsupported Format Requests
```gherkin
Given users may request unsupported formats
When format is not supported
Then:
  - Provide clear error message
  - Suggest alternative formats
  - Document format support matrix
  - Provide conversion alternatives
  - Track format requests for future support
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given format conversion can expose sensitive data
Then implement security controls:
  | Security Control       | Implementation                          |
  | Input validation      | Strict validation of input certificates  |
  | Output validation     | Verify converted format integrity        |
  | Temporary file security| Secure creation and deletion            |
  | Memory protection     | Clear sensitive data after use          |
  | Access logging        | Log all format conversion requests       |
  | Rate limiting         | Prevent abuse of conversion services     |
  | Error handling        | No sensitive data in error messages     |
  | Format restrictions   | Block conversion to insecure formats    |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given format conversion affects user experience
Then meet these targets:
  | Performance Metric     | Target                                  |
  | Single certificate    | < 100ms conversion time                 |
  | Small batch (10)      | < 500ms conversion time                 |
  | Medium batch (100)    | < 5 seconds conversion time             |
  | Large batch (1000+)   | < 60 seconds with progress updates      |
  | File size efficiency  | < 20% overhead for any format           |
  | Memory usage          | < 100MB for largest supported batch     |
```

## Integration Examples
