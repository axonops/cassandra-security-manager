- **Negotiable**: Specific PQ algorithms can be adjusted per NIST
- **Valuable**: Future-proofs certificate infrastructure
- **Estimable**: 3 sprints including testing and validation
- **Small**: Focused on PQ algorithm implementation
- **Testable**: Algorithm correctness and compatibility verifiable

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Post-Quantum Algorithm Support
```gherkin
Given NIST has Standardised post-quantum algorithms
When I request a certificate with PQ algorithms
Then support the following:
  | Algorithm Type | Algorithms               | Security Level | Use Case           |
  | Signatures    | CRYSTALS-Dilithium       | 2, 3, 5       | All certificates   |
  |               | FALCON                   | 512, 1024     | Constrained devices|
  |               | SPHINCS+                 | 128, 192, 256 | Long-term signing  |
  | KEM          | CRYSTALS-Kyber           | 512, 768, 1024| Key encapsulation  |
And provide selection guidance:
  - Dilithium-3 for general use
  - FALCON for resource-constrained
  - SPHINCS+ for long-term archives
  - Kyber-768 for key exchange
```

### Scenario: Hybrid Certificate Generation
```gherkin
Given compatibility with existing systems is required
When generating a hybrid certificate
Then combine classical and post-quantum:
{
  "request": {
    "common_name": "node1.cassandra.local",
    "hybrid_mode": true,
    "algorithms": {
      "classical": {
        "type": "ECDSA",
        "curve": "P-384"
      },
      "post_quantum": {
        "type": "DILITHIUM",
        "level": 3
      }
    }
  }
}
And the certificate should contain:
  - Two public keys (classical + PQ)
  - Composite signature
  - Dual algorithm identifiers
  - Extensions marking hybrid mode
And validate with either algorithm
```

### Scenario: Algorithm Security Validation
```gherkin
Given only secure algorithms should be used
When an algorithm is requested
Then enforce security policy:
  | Algorithm         | Status    | Reason                           |
  | RSA-2048         | BLOCKED   | Below 3072-bit minimum          |
  | RSA-4096         | ALLOWED   | Meets security requirements      |
  | ECDSA-P256       | WARNING   | Use P-384 for better security   |
  | ECDSA-P384       | ALLOWED   | Recommended                      |
  | Dilithium-2      | ALLOWED   | NIST Level 2 security           |
  | Dilithium-3      | PREFERRED | NIST Level 3 security           |
  | MD5              | BLOCKED   | Cryptographically broken        |
  | SHA-256          | ALLOWED   | Minimum hash standard           |
  | SHA-384          | PREFERRED | Better security margin          |
  | SHA3-256         | ALLOWED   | Quantum-resistant hash          |
```

### Scenario: Performance Optimisation
```gherkin
Given PQ algorithms have different performance characteristics
When generating certificates
Then optimise based on use case:
  | Operation          | Classical Time | PQ Time    | Hybrid Time | Optimisation          |
  | Key Generation    | 10ms          | 50ms       | 60ms        | Parallel generation   |
  | Signing           | 5ms           | 20ms       | 25ms        | Hardware acceleration |
  | Verification      | 2ms           | 30ms       | 32ms        | Caching strategies    |
  | Certificate Size  | 2KB           | 5KB        | 7KB         | Compression           |
And implement optimisations:
  - Parallel key generation
  - Batch operations
  - Hardware acceleration (AVX2/AVX512)
  - Precomputed values
  - Connection pooling for HSM
```

### Scenario: Cassandra Compatibility Mode
```gherkin
Given Cassandra must accept certificates
When generating for Cassandra nodes
Then ensure compatibility:
  | Requirement              | Implementation                           |
  | Java KeyStore support   | Provide JKS export with classical only   |
  | TLS handshake          | Use classical for initial handshake      |
  | Certificate size       | Warn if > 16KB (TLS limitation)         |
  | Signature algorithm    | Map to Java-supported algorithms         |
  | Key exchange           | Hybrid mode for future compatibility     |
And provide migration path:
  - Phase 1: Classical only (current Cassandra)
  - Phase 2: Hybrid mode (backward compatible)
  - Phase 3: PQ preferred (future Cassandra)
```

### Scenario: Algorithm Agility Implementation
```gherkin
Given algorithms may need rapid replacement
When implementing algorithm support
Then design for agility:
  | Component           | Agility Feature                            |
  | Configuration      | Runtime algorithm selection                 |
  | Storage            | Algorithm-agnostic key storage             |
  | APIs               | Version-specific algorithm sets            |
  | Migration          | Bulk re-certification tools                |
  | Compatibility      | Multi-algorithm validation                 |
And support transitions:
  - Dual certificates during migration
  - Gradual rollout capabilities
  - Rollback mechanisms
  - Performance monitoring
```

### Scenario: Quantum-Safe Random Number Generation
```gherkin
Given PQ algorithms need quality randomness
When generating keys
Then ensure quantum-safe entropy:
  | Source              | Usage                    | Validation           |
  | Hardware RNG       | Primary source           | FIPS 140-2 certified |
  | OS Entropy         | Secondary source         | /dev/urandom or better|
  | QRNG               | When available           | Quantum RNG devices  |
  | DRBG               | Expansion               | NIST SP 800-90A      |
And implement safeguards:
  - Entropy health monitoring
  - Multiple source mixing
  - Continuous testing
  - Fail-safe to secure defaults
```

### Scenario: Certificate Template Support
```gherkin
Given common certificate types have standard requirements
When using templates
Then provide PQ-ready templates:
  | Template              | Classical         | Post-Quantum      | Use Case            |
  | cassandra_node       | ECDSA-P384        | Dilithium-3       | Node certificates   |
  | client_auth          | RSA-4096          | Dilithium-2       | Client applications |
  | code_signing         | ECDSA-P384        | SPHINCS+-256      | Software signing    |
  | tls_server           | ECDSA-P384        | Dilithium-3       | TLS endpoints       |
  | long_term_archive    | RSA-4096          | SPHINCS+-256      | 20+ year validity   |
And allow customisation while maintaining security
```

### Scenario: Compliance and Standards
```gherkin
Given various standards govern PQ cryptography
When implementing algorithms
Then comply with:
  | Standard           | Requirement                                |
  | NIST PQC          | Use only standardised algorithms           |
  | CNSA 2.0          | Meet NSA quantum-resistant requirements    |
  | ETSI             | European quantum-safe specifications       |
  | BSI              | German federal security requirements       |
  | IETF             | Protocol integration standards             |
And maintain compliance evidence:
  - Algorithm implementation certificates
  - Test vectors validation
  - Interoperability testing
  - Security assessments
```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Algorithm Downgrade Attack
```gherkin
Given attackers may force weaker algorithms
When negotiating algorithms
Then:
  - Enforce minimum algorithm strength
  - Detect downgrade attempts
  - Log security events
  - Fail closed (no weak algorithms)
  - Alert on patterns
```

### Edge Case: Certificate Size Limits
```gherkin
Given PQ certificates are larger
When size exceeds limits
Then:
  - Warn about compatibility issues
  - Offer compression options
  - Suggest alternative algorithms
  - Document size implications
  - Provide chunking for transport
```

### Edge Case: HSM Algorithm Support
```gherkin
Given HSMs may not support PQ algorithms
When HSM lacks support
Then:
  - Fall back to software implementation
  - Hybrid approach (classical in HSM)
  - Queue for future HSM support
  - Maintain security posture
  - Document limitations
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given performance is critical
Then meet these targets:
  | Operation               | Target Time  | Acceptable Range |
  | RSA-4096 generation    | < 500ms      | 200-1000ms       |
  | ECDSA-P384 generation  | < 50ms       | 20-100ms         |
  | Dilithium-3 generation | < 100ms      | 50-200ms         |
  | Hybrid generation      | < 150ms      | 75-300ms         |
  | Signature operation    | < 50ms       | 10-100ms         |
  | Batch (100 certs)      | < 10s        | 5-20s            |
```
