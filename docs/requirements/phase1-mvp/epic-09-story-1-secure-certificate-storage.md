# User Story 09.1 - Secure Certificate Storage

## User Story
**As a** security administrator  
**I want** certificates and private keys stored with military-grade encryption  
**So that** certificate data remains secure even if storage is compromised

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Storage security can be implemented separately
- **Negotiable**: Encryption algorithms and key management approaches flexible
- **Valuable**: Fundamental security requirement for certificate infrastructure
- **Estimable**: 2 sprints for complete encrypted storage system
- **Small**: Focused on storage security only
- **Testable**: Encryption and security controls are verifiable

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Private Key Encryption at Rest
```gherkin
Given private keys must never be stored in plaintext
When storing a private key
Then encrypt using envelope encryption:
{
  "storage_model": {
    "kek": {
      "algorithm": "AES-256-GCM",
      "source": "HSM or Key Management Service",
      "rotation_period": "90 days",
      "backup_copies": 3
    },
    "dek": {
      "algorithm": "AES-256-GCM", 
      "unique_per_key": true,
      "encrypted_by_kek": true,
      "iv_unique": true
    },
    "private_key": {
      "encrypted_by_dek": true,
      "format": "PKCS#8",
      "never_logged": true,
      "access_audited": true
    }
  }
}
And ensure private keys are never exposed in:
  - API responses
  - Log files
  - Error messages
  - Memory dumps
  - Backup files without encryption
```

### Scenario: Certificate Storage Schema
```gherkin
Given certificates need efficient storage and retrieval
When designing the storage schema
Then implement in Cassandra:
  | Table                   | Purpose                                 |
  | certificates           | Main certificate storage                |
  | certificate_chains     | Certificate chain relationships         |
  | private_keys           | Encrypted private key storage           |
  | certificate_metadata   | Searchable metadata and indexes         |
  | certificate_audit      | Complete audit trail                    |
  | revocation_lists       | CRL and OCSP response cache            |
  | storage_metrics        | Performance and usage statistics        |
And Optimise for:
  - Fast certificate retrieval by serial number
  - Subject and SAN-based searches
  - Expiration date queries
  - CA hierarchy navigation
  - Audit trail queries
```

### Scenario: Multi-Level Security Zones
```gherkin
Given different certificates have different security requirements
When storing certificates
Then implement security zones:
  | Security Zone          | Certificate Types          | Protection Level         |
  | Ultra High            | Root CA private keys       | HSM + Air gap + Quorum   |
  | High                  | Subordinate CA keys        | HSM + Multi-party auth   |
  | Medium                | Server certificates        | Software encryption       |
  | Standard              | Client certificates        | Standard encryption       |
  | Development           | Test certificates          | Basic encryption          |
And enforce zone-based access controls:
  - Ultra High: Requires quorum of 3 admins
  - High: Requires 2-person Authorisation
  - Medium: Requires admin role
  - Standard: Requires appropriate role
  - Development: Self-service allowed
```

### Scenario: Hardware Security Module Integration
```gherkin
Given HSMs provide highest security for key operations
When HSM is available
Then integrate for:
  | HSM Function            | Implementation                          |
  | Root CA key generation | Generate and store in HSM              |
  | Key Encryption Keys    | Store KEKs in HSM                       |
  | Signing operations     | Perform signing within HSM              |
  | Key backup             | Secure key backup to secondary HSM     |
  | Authentication         | HSM-based operator authentication      |
  | Audit trail           | HSM-generated audit logs                |
And support HSM failover:
  - Multiple HSM devices
  - Automatic failover
  - Load balancing
  - Health monitoring
And maintain HSM compliance:
  - FIPS 140-2 Level 3 minimum
  - Common Criteria certification
  - Regular security audits
```

### Scenario: Distributed Storage Security
```gherkin
Given data is distributed across Cassandra nodes
When storing sensitive data
Then implement distributed security:
  | Security Aspect         | Implementation                          |
  | Node authentication    | Mutual TLS between nodes                |
  | Data encryption        | Transparent data encryption (TDE)       |
  | Network security       | Encrypted communication only            |
  | Access control         | Node-level access restrictions          |
  | Data residency         | Geographic data placement controls      |
  | Replication security   | Encrypted replication streams           |
And ensure consistency:
  - Quorum reads for sensitive operations
  - Consistent hashing for data placement
  - Anti-entropy for data consistency
  - Repair processes for data integrity
```

### Scenario: Key Management Lifecycle
```gherkin
Given encryption keys have their own lifecycle
When managing encryption keys
Then implement key lifecycle:
  | Lifecycle Stage         | Operations                              |
  | Key generation         | Secure random generation with entropy   |
  | Key activation         | Controlled activation process           |
  | Key rotation           | Periodic key rotation (90 days)        |
  | Key archival           | Secure archival for data recovery       |
  | Key destruction        | Secure key destruction when no longer needed|
And track key usage:
  - Which data encrypted with which key
  - Key rotation impact analysis
  - Re-encryption requirements
  - Performance impact of key operations
```

### Scenario: Backup and Recovery Security
```gherkin
Given backups must maintain security posture
When backing up certificate data
Then ensure secure backup:
  | Backup Component        | Security Measures                       |
  | Certificate data       | Encrypted with separate backup keys     |
  | Private keys           | Double encryption (original + backup)   |
  | Metadata              | Encrypted and integrity protected       |
  | Audit logs            | Immutable backup with digital signatures|
  | Configuration         | Encrypted configuration backups         |
  | Key material          | Secure key escrow procedures            |
And implement recovery procedures:
  - Multi-person recovery Authorisation
  - Integrity verification during recovery
  - Audit trail of recovery operations
  - Test recovery procedures regularly
```

### Scenario: Data Classification and Handling
```gherkin
Given different data types require different handling
When storing certificate-related data
Then classify and handle appropriately:
  | Data Classification    | Examples                    | Handling Requirements       |
  | Top Secret            | Root CA private keys        | HSM, air gap, multi-party   |
  | Secret                | Sub-CA private keys         | HSM, dual Authorisation     |
  | Confidential          | Server private keys         | Encrypted storage           |
  | Internal Use          | Certificate metadata        | Access controlled           |
  | Public                | Public certificates         | Standard storage            |
And implement data loss prevention:
  - Data leakage monitoring
  - Exfiltration detection
  - Access pattern analysis
  - Unauthorized access alerts
```

### Scenario: Compliance and Regulatory Requirements
```gherkin
Given various compliance frameworks apply
When storing certificate data
Then meet regulatory requirements:
  | Regulation             | Requirements                            |
  | PCI DSS               | Strong cryptography, key management     |
  | HIPAA                 | Administrative, physical, technical safeguards|
  | SOX                   | Financial system access controls        |
  | GDPR                  | Data protection and privacy rights      |
  | FIPS 140-2            | Cryptographic module requirements       |
  | Common Criteria       | Security evaluation standards           |
And maintain compliance evidence:
  - Continuous monitoring
  - Regular assessments
  - Compliance reporting
  - Remediation tracking
```

### Scenario: Performance and Scalability
```gherkin
Given storage must scale to millions of certificates
When designing for scale
Then Optimise for performance:
  | Performance Target      | Implementation                          |
  | Storage latency        | < 50ms for write operations            |
  | Retrieval latency      | < 100ms for single certificate         |
  | Bulk operations        | 1000+ certificates per second           |
  | Concurrent access      | 500+ simultaneous operations            |
  | Storage efficiency     | < 10KB per certificate average          |
  | Compression ratio      | 30%+ reduction for large certificates   |
And implement Optimisations:
  - SSD storage for hot data
  - Tiered storage for archival
  - Connection pooling
  - Batch operations
  - Compression algorithms
  - Caching strategies
```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Encryption Key Compromise
```gherkin
Given encryption keys may be compromised
When key compromise is detected
Then:
  - Immediately rotate affected keys
  - Re-encrypt all affected data
  - Audit access patterns for indicators
  - Notify affected certificate holders
  - Document incident response
```

### Edge Case: HSM Failure
```gherkin
Given HSMs can fail
When HSM becomes unavailable
Then:
  - Failover to backup HSM
  - Use software fallback if configured
  - Queue operations if possible
  - Alert administrators immediately
  - Maintain audit trail of fallback operations
```

### Edge Case: Storage Corruption
```gherkin
Given storage systems can be corrupted
When data corruption is detected
Then:
  - Verify integrity using checksums
  - Restore from backup if necessary
  - Identify root cause of corruption
  - Implement additional integrity checks
  - Notify affected parties
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given storage is a critical attack vector
Then implement comprehensive security:
  | Security Control        | Implementation                          |
  | Encryption at rest     | AES-256-GCM for all sensitive data     |
  | Encryption in transit  | TLS 1.3 for all network communication  |
  | Access controls        | Role-based access with least privilege |
  | Audit logging          | Complete audit trail of all operations |
  | Integrity protection   | Cryptographic checksums for all data   |
  | Secure deletion        | Cryptographic erasure when possible     |
  | Zero-trust architecture| Verify every access request             |
  | Defence in depth       | Multiple layers of security controls    |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given performance affects system usability
Then meet these targets:
  | Performance Metric      | Target                                  |
  | Write latency          | < 50ms for single certificate          |
  | Read latency           | < 100ms for single certificate         |
  | Bulk write throughput  | 1000+ certificates per second           |
  | Search performance     | < 500ms for complex queries            |
  | Backup performance     | Complete backup within 4 hours         |
  | Recovery time          | < 30 minutes for single certificate    |
```
