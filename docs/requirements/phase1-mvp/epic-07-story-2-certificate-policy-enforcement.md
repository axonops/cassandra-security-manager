# User Story  07.2 - Certificate Policy Enforcement

## User Story
**As a** security administrator  
**I want** policy-based certificate generation  
**So that** all certificates meet organisational standards automatically

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Policy engine can be developed separately
- **Negotiable**: Specific policies can be customised
- **Valuable**: Ensures consistent security standards
- **Estimable**: 2 sprints for comprehensive policy engine
- **Small**: Focused on policy validation during generation
- **Testable**: Policy decisions are deterministic

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Policy Definition and Management
```gherkin
Given organisations have specific certificate requirements
When defining certificate policies
Then support comprehensive rules:
{
  "policy_name": "production_cassandra_nodes",
  "priority": 100,
  "conditions": {
    "request_type": "NODE_CERTIFICATE",
    "environment": "PRODUCTION"
  },
  "rules": {
    "key_requirements": {
      "minimum_rsa_size": 4096,
      "minimum_ecdsa_curve": "P-384",
      "allowed_algorithms": ["RSA", "ECDSA", "DILITHIUM-3"],
      "require_hardware_key": false
    },
    "validity_constraints": {
      "maximum_days": 365,
      "minimum_days": 30,
      "not_before_offset": "-1h",
      "renewal_window": 30
    },
    "subject_constraints": {
      "cn_pattern": "^[a-z0-9\\-]+\\.cassandra\\.local$",
      "required_ou": ["Cassandra Nodes", "Infrastructure"],
      "forbidden_values": ["test", "temp", "tmp"]
    },
    "extension_requirements": {
      "required_key_usage": ["digitalSignature", "keyEncipherment"],
      "required_ext_key_usage": ["serverAuth", "clientAuth"],
      "san_requirements": {
        "require_dns": true,
        "require_ip": true,
        "dns_pattern": "^[a-z0-9\\-]+\\.(cassandra|node)\\.local$"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Scenario: Policy Evaluation Engine
```gherkin
Given multiple policies may apply to a request
When evaluating policies
Then follow evaluation order:
  | Step                   | Process                                      |
  | 1. Match policies     | Find all policies matching request context   |
  | 2. Sort by priority   | Higher priority policies evaluated first     |
  | 3. Apply rules        | Each rule must pass or fail explicitly      |
  | 4. Conflict resolution| Most restrictive rule wins                   |
  | 5. Default policy     | Apply if no specific policy matches          |
  | 6. Audit decision     | Log which policies applied and why           |
And provide clear feedback:
{
  "policy_result": "DENIED",
  "applied_policies": ["production_cassandra_nodes", "global_security"],
  "violations": [
    {
      "policy": "production_cassandra_nodes",
      "rule": "validity_constraints.maximum_days",
      "requested": 730,
      "allowed": 365,
      "message": "Certificate validity exceeds maximum of 365 days"
    }
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Reduce validity period to 365 days or less",
    "Request exception approval for longer validity"
  ]
}
```

### Scenario: Organisational Hierarchy Policies
```gherkin
Given organisations have hierarchical structures
When applying policies
Then support inheritance:
```
Global Policy (Base Requirements)
├── Division Policy (Additional Constraints)
│   ├── Department Policy (Specific Rules)
│   │   ├── Team Policy (Overrides)
│   │   └── Project Policy (Exceptions)
│   └── Service Policy (Custom Rules)
└── Compliance Policy (Regulatory)
```
And implement inheritance rules:
  - Child policies inherit parent rules
  - Child can add constraints (more restrictive)
  - Child cannot relax parent constraints
  - Explicit overrides require approval
  - Audit trail for policy hierarchy
```

### Scenario: Dynamic Policy Updates
```gherkin
Given policies need to change without downtime
When updating policies
Then support hot reload:
  | Update Type          | Behaviour                                    |
  | Add new policy      | Immediately active for new requests         |
  | Modify existing     | Version policy, apply to new requests       |
  | Delete policy       | Mark inactive, maintain for audit           |
  | Emergency override  | Temporary policy with expiration            |
And maintain consistency:
  - In-flight requests use original policy
  - Policy versioning for history
  - Rollback capabilities
  - Change notification to admins
  - Test mode for validation
```

### Scenario: Certificate Template Policies
```gherkin
Given common use cases need standardisation
When using certificate templates
Then enforce template-specific policies:
  | Template              | Enforced Policies                          |
  | cassandra_node       | Node naming, cluster membership, validity   |
  | client_application   | App identification, auth methods, scope     |
  | user_certificate     | Identity verification, email in SAN         |
  | monitoring_service   | Read-only permissions, short validity       |
  | backup_service       | Encryption-only keys, specific paths        |
And prevent template misuse:
  - Template selection requires authorisation
  - Templates enforce non-negotiable rules
  - Custom requests validated against template
  - Audit template usage patterns
```

### Scenario: Compliance Policy Mapping
```gherkin
Given regulatory requirements must be met
When generating certificates
Then map compliance requirements:
  | Regulation          | Certificate Requirements                    |
  | PCI DSS            | Strong crypto, annual renewal, key storage  |
  | HIPAA              | Identity assurance, audit trails, encryption|
  | SOC 2              | Access controls, monitoring, key management |
  | GDPR               | Data residency, purpose limitation          |
  | FIPS 140-2         | Approved algorithms, validated modules      |
And enforce automatically:
  - Tag certificates with compliance scope
  - Prevent non-compliant generation
  - Generate compliance reports
  - Alert on policy violations
```

### Scenario: Policy Exception Handling
```gherkin
Given legitimate exceptions may be needed
When policy violation requires override
Then implement exception workflow:
{
  "exception_request": {
    "certificate_request_id": "req-123",
    "policy_violations": ["validity_too_long", "weak_key_size"],
    "justification": "Legacy system compatibility required",
    "risk_acceptance": "Security team approved compensating controls",
    "approvers": ["security_admin", "compliance_officer"],
    "expiration": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  }
}
And require:
  - Multi-person approval
  - Time-limited exceptions
  - Compensating controls
  - Enhanced monitoring
  - Regular review
```

### Scenario: Policy Testing and Simulation
```gherkin
Given policy changes need validation
When testing policies
Then provide simulation mode:
  | Test Type           | Function                                    |
  | Dry run            | Evaluate without generating                 |
  | What-if analysis   | Test policy changes impact                  |
  | Coverage report    | Show which rules are used/unused           |
  | Conflict detection | Identify contradictory rules               |
  | Performance test   | Measure policy evaluation time              |
And support:
  - Test with historical requests
  - A/B policy testing
  - Gradual rollout
  - Impact analysis
```

### Scenario: Policy Metrics and Monitoring
```gherkin
Given policy effectiveness needs measurement
When collecting metrics
Then track:
  | Metric                    | Purpose                              |
  | Policy hit rate          | Which policies are most used         |
  | Violation frequency      | Common policy failures               |
  | Exception rate           | How often overrides needed           |
  | Evaluation time          | Performance impact                   |
  | Certificate compliance   | % meeting all policies               |
And alert on:
  - Unusual violation patterns
  - Excessive exceptions
  - Policy bypass attempts
  - Performance degradation
```

### Scenario: Cross-Domain Policy Federation
```gherkin
Given multi-cluster deployments exist
When federating policies
Then support:
  | Federation Type      | Implementation                           |
  | Policy sync         | Replicate policies across regions        |
  | Central management  | Single source of truth                   |
  | Local overrides     | Region-specific adjustments              |
  | Conflict resolution | Clear precedence rules                   |
And ensure:
  - Consistent policy application
  - Audit trail across domains
  - Secure policy distribution
  - Version compatibility
```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Policy Loop/Deadlock
```gherkin
Given complex policies may conflict
When circular dependencies exist
Then:
  - Detect loops during validation
  - Refuse to activate conflicting policies
  - Provide clear error messages
  - Suggest resolution steps
  - Maintain system stability
```

### Edge Case: Policy Performance Impact
```gherkin
Given complex policies slow generation
When performance degrades
Then:
  - Cache policy decisions
  - Optimise rule evaluation
  - Set evaluation timeout
  - Fall back to simple policies
  - Alert administrators
```

### Edge Case: Missing Policy
```gherkin
Given requests may not match any policy
When no policy applies
Then:
  - Apply default deny policy
  - Log unmatched request
  - Suggest closest matching policy
  - Allow explicit default policy
  - Monitor for patterns
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given policies control security
Then implement protections:
  | Protection            | Implementation                          |
  | Policy tampering     | Cryptographic policy signatures         |
  | Unauthorised changes | Role-based policy management            |
  | Audit trail          | Immutable policy change log             |
  | Version control      | Git-backed policy storage               |
  | Testing required     | Mandatory validation before activation   |
```
