# User Story 08.2 - Developer Portal

## User Story
**As a** software developer  
**I want** a self-service portal for certificate requests and management  
**So that** I can obtain certificates for my applications without waiting for admin approval

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Developer portal separate from admin interface
- **Negotiable**: Self-service vs approval workflows configurable
- **Valuable**: Reduces administrative overhead and development friction
- **Estimable**: 2 sprints for core developer functionality
- **Small**: Focused on developer self-service operations
- **Testable**: Developer workflows can be automated and validated

## Acceptance Criteria

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Template Policy Conflicts
```gherkin
Given multiple policies may apply to templates
When policy conflicts occur
Then:
  - Show clear error messages with explanation
  - Suggest alternative templates
  - Escalate to admin if needed
  - Log policy conflicts for review
  - Provide workaround guidance
```

### Edge Case: Quota and Rate Limits
```gherkin
Given developers have usage limits
When limits are reached
Then:
  - Show clear quota status
  - Explain how to request increases
  - Provide usage Optimisation tips
  - Queue requests if possible
  - Alert before hitting limits
```

### Edge Case: Certificate Dependencies
```gherkin
Given certificates may have dependencies
When viewing certificate relationships
Then:
  - Show certificate chains visually
  - Highlight dependency impacts
  - Warn about cascade effects
  - Provide dependency resolution tools
  - Track related certificate lifecycles
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given developers access sensitive certificate operations
Then implement security controls:
  | Security Control        | Implementation                          |
  | Input validation       | Strict validation of all user inputs    |
  | Output encoding        | Prevent XSS and injection attacks       |
  | CSRF protection        | Anti-CSRF tokens for all operations     |
  | Rate limiting          | Per-user limits on certificate requests |
  | Audit logging          | Complete audit trail of all actions    |
  | Secure defaults        | Safe default values for all options     |
  | Permission checks      | Verify permissions for every operation  |
  | Session management     | Secure session handling and timeout     |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given developer productivity depends on portal performance
Then meet these targets:
  | Performance Metric      | Target                                  |
  | Page load time         | < 2 seconds initial load                |
  | Certificate search     | < 500ms for personal certificates      |
  | Template loading       | < 300ms for template selection         |
  | Request submission     | < 1 second for form processing         |
  | API documentation      | < 1 second for doc page loads          |
  | Mobile performance     | < 3 seconds on mobile networks         |
```

## Integration Examples

### Java Spring Boot Integration
```java
// Auto-configuration for certificate management
@ConfigurationProperties("app.certificates")
public class CertificateConfig {
    private String keystorePath;
    private String keystorePassword;
    private String certificateId;
    // Certificate auto-renewal configuration
}
```

### Python FastAPI Integration
```python
# Certificate middleware for automatic validation
@app.middleware("https")
async def certificate_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    # Automatic certificate validation and renewal
    pass
```
