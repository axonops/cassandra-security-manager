# Phase 1 Epic 09: Certificate Storage and Retrieval

## Overview
Secure storage and efficient retrieval of certificates and private keys is fundamental to certificate lifecycle management. This epic implements encrypted storage, multiple export formats, and high-performance search capabilities while maintaining the highest security standards.

## User Stories
1. **4.1 - Secure Certificate Storage**: Encrypted storage of certificates and private keys
2. **4.2 - Certificate Format Support**: Multiple export formats and compatibility layers

## Dependencies
- A3 (Data Persistence) - Uses Cassandra for storage
- A4 (Security Fundamentals) - Encryption and key management
- Epic 1 (CA Hierarchy) - Certificate chain storage
- Epic 2 (Certificates) - Generated certificates to store

## Success Metrics
- Certificate storage latency < 50ms
- Retrieval performance < 100ms for single certificate
- 100% encryption at rest for private keys
- Support for 5+ export formats
- Zero private key exposure in logs/APIs
- 99.99% storage availability

## Technical Considerations
- AES-256-GCM encryption for private keys
- Separate key encryption keys (KEK) and data encryption keys (DEK)
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration ready
- Certificate indexing for fast search
- Chunked storage for large certificates
- Distributed storage across Cassandra nodes
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Audit trail for all storage operations
