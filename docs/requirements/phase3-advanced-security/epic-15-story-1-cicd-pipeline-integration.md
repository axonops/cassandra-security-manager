# 15.1 - CI/CD Pipeline Integration

## User Story
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** native CI/CD pipeline integration for certificate operations  
**So that** certificate management is seamlessly incorporated into our deployment workflows

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: CI/CD integration can be developed separately from core features
- **Negotiable**: Integration methods and platforms are configurable
- **Valuable**: Enables automated certificate management in modern DevOps workflows
- **Estimable**: 4 sprints for comprehensive CI/CD platform coverage
- **Small**: Focused on pipeline integration and automation only
- **Testable**: Integration success and automation metrics are measurable

## Acceptance Criteria

```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Pipeline Failures During Certificate Operations
```gherkin
Given pipelines may fail mid-operation
When certificate generation is interrupted
Then:
  - Implement atomic operations
  - Clean up partial certificates
  - Prevent orphaned resources
  - Provide clear error messages
  - Enable operation resumption
```

### Edge Case: Concurrent Pipeline Executions
```gherkin
Given multiple pipelines may run simultaneously
When requesting certificates concurrently
Then:
  - Handle race conditions
  - Implement request queuing
  - Prevent duplicate certificates
  - Manage rate limits
  - Ensure consistent state
```

### Edge Case: Cross-Environment Dependencies
```gherkin
Given certificates may span environments
When managing multi-environment pipelines
Then:
  - Track cross-environment dependencies
  - Coordinate certificate updates
  - Handle environment-specific policies
  - Manage promotion workflows
  - Maintain environment isolation
```

### Edge Case: Large-Scale Pipeline Operations
```gherkin
Given enterprises have many pipelines
When scaling certificate operations
Then:
  - Support thousands of pipelines
  - Implement efficient batching
  - Provide pipeline grouping
  - Enable bulk operations
  - Optimise for performance
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given CI/CD integrations are security-sensitive
Then implement comprehensive security:
  | Security Control     | Implementation                         |
  | Authentication      | Pipeline-specific service accounts     |
  | Authorisation       | Fine-grained pipeline permissions      |
  | Secrets protection  | Encrypted credential storage           |
  | Network security    | Private endpoint connections           |
  | Audit logging       | Complete pipeline operation logs       |
  | Input validation    | Sanitize all pipeline inputs           |
  | Rate limiting       | Prevent pipeline abuse                 |
  | Compliance          | Pipeline security scanning             |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given pipelines require fast execution
Then meet these performance targets:
  | Performance Metric   | Target                                 |
  | Certificate request | < 30 seconds from request to ready     |
  | Pipeline overhead   | < 5% additional pipeline time          |
  | Concurrent requests | 100+ simultaneous pipeline requests    |
  | API response time   | < 200ms for status checks              |
  | Bulk operations     | 1000+ certificates per hour            |
  | Cache efficiency    | 90%+ cache hit rate                    |
```

## Integration Examples

                        ]
                    )

                    )
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy Certificate') {
            steps {
