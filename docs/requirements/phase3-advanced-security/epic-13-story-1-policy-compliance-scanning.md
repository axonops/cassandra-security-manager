# 13.1 - Policy Compliance Scanning

## User Story
**As a** security compliance manager  
**I want** automated scanning for policy compliance violations  
**So that** security policies are continuously enforced and compliance is maintained

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Policy scanning can be developed separately from other features
- **Negotiable**: Policy rules and scanning methods are configurable
- **Valuable**: Ensures continuous compliance and reduces manual auditing
- **Estimable**: 3 sprints for comprehensive compliance scanning
- **Small**: Focused on policy scanning and violation detection only
- **Testable**: Compliance accuracy and coverage are measurable

## Acceptance Criteria

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Policy Conflicts
```gherkin
Given multiple policies may conflict
When policy conflicts occur
Then:
  - Detect and flag policy conflicts
  - Provide conflict resolution rules
  - Support policy precedence
  - Allow manual override with justification
  - Maintain conflict resolution audit trail
```

### Edge Case: Performance Impact
```gherkin
Given scanning may impact system performance
When performance degradation occurs
Then:
  - Implement adaptive scanning rates
  - Support off-peak scanning schedules
  - Provide resource usage controls
  - Enable incremental scanning
  - Offer performance impact predictions
```

### Edge Case: Rapid Policy Changes
```gherkin
Given policies may change frequently
When policy updates occur rapidly
Then:
  - Queue policy changes for validation
  - Implement change windows
  - Support emergency policy updates
  - Provide rollback capabilities
  - Maintain policy change history
```

### Edge Case: Large-Scale Environments
```gherkin
Given enterprises may have millions of certificates
When scanning at scale
Then:
  - Implement distributed scanning
  - Support scan result aggregation
  - Provide scan progress tracking
  - Enable partial result processing
  - Optimise for massive datasets
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given compliance scanning has security implications
Then implement comprehensive security:
  | Security Control     | Implementation                         |
  | Access control      | Role-based access to scanning functions|
  | Policy protection   | Encrypt policies at rest and in transit|
  | Scan Authorisation  | Require approval for scan execution    |
  | Result protection   | Secure storage of scan results         |
  | Audit logging      | Complete trail of scanning activities  |
  | Input validation   | Validate all policy definitions        |
  | Injection prevention| Sanitize policy rule inputs           |
  | Privilege separation| Separate scan and remediation privileges|
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given compliance scanning must be efficient
Then meet these performance targets:
  | Performance Metric   | Target                                 |
  | Policy evaluation   | < 100ms per certificate                |
  | Bulk scanning      | 10,000+ certificates per minute        |
  | Real-time detection | < 1 second violation detection         |
  | Report generation  | < 30 seconds for compliance report     |
  | Memory efficiency  | < 4GB for scanner instance             |
  | API response time  | < 200ms for compliance queries         |
```
