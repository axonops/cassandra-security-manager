# 12.1 - Network Certificate Scanning

## User Story
**As a** security administrator  
**I want** automated network scanning to discover all certificates in use  
**So that** I have complete visibility of the certificate landscape and can identify shadow certificates

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: Certificate scanning can be developed separately from other features
- **Negotiable**: Scanning methods and protocols are configurable
- **Valuable**: Provides critical visibility into certificate infrastructure
- **Estimable**: 3 sprints for comprehensive scanning implementation
- **Small**: Focused on certificate discovery through network scanning only
- **Testable**: Discovery accuracy and completeness are measurable

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Multi-Protocol Certificate Discovery
```gherkin
Given certificates are used across multiple network protocols
When performing network certificate discovery
Then support comprehensive protocol scanning:
{
  "supported_protocols": {
    "web_protocols": {
      "HTTPS": { "port": 443, "tls_versions": ["1.2", "1.3"] },
      "HTTP/2": { "port": 443, "alpn": ["h2", "h2c"] },
      "HTTP/3": { "port": 443, "quic": true }
    },
    "email_protocols": {
      "SMTPS": { "port": 465, "implicit_tls": true },
      "SMTP_STARTTLS": { "port": 25, "explicit_tls": true },
      "IMAPS": { "port": 993, "implicit_tls": true },
      "POP3S": { "port": 995, "implicit_tls": true }
    },
    "directory_protocols": {
      "LDAPS": { "port": 636, "implicit_tls": true },
      "LDAP_STARTTLS": { "port": 389, "explicit_tls": true }
    },
    "database_protocols": {
      "PostgreSQL": { "port": 5432, "sslmode": "require" },
      "MySQL": { "port": 3306, "ssl_enabled": true },
      "MongoDB": { "port": 27017, "tls": true },
      "Cassandra": { "port": 9042, "native_protocol": true }
    },
    "messaging_protocols": {
      "AMQPS": { "port": 5671, "implicit_tls": true },
      "MQTTS": { "port": 8883, "implicit_tls": true },
      "Kafka": { "port": 9093, "security_protocol": "SSL" }
    },
    "custom_protocols": {
      "proprietary": { "configurable_ports": true, "tls_detection": true }
    }
  }
}

  - Dynamic port discovery through service registry
  - Non-standard port detection
  - Protocol multiplexing support (ALPN/NPN)
```

  - Network topology awareness
  - Bandwidth throttling controls
```

### Scenario: Certificate Chain Discovery and Validation
```gherkin

  | End-entity certificate| Subject, validity, key usage          |
  | Intermediate CAs    | CA constraints, path length            |
  | Root CA            | Trust store membership                 |
  | Cross-certificates  | Bridge CA validation                   |

When discovering certificates
Then detect shadow certificates:
  | Detection Method     | Implementation                         |
  | Unknown CAs         | Certificates from unauthorized CAs     |

  | Certificate details | Subject, issuer, serial, validity      |
  | Key information    | Algorithm, size, usage constraints     |
  | Extensions         | SAN, key usage, policy OIDs            |
  | Network context    | IP, hostname, port, protocol           |
  | Service context    | Application, version, configuration    |
And enrich with additional data:
  - Geolocation of certificate endpoints
  - Service ownership from CMDB
  - Historical certificate data
  - Vulnerability correlation
  - Business criticality scoring
```

### Scenario: Scan Scheduling and Automation
```gherkin
Given continuous discovery is required
When scheduling certificate scans
Then provide flexible scheduling:
  | Schedule Type        | Configuration Options                  |
  | Continuous scanning | Real-time discovery of new services    |
  | Periodic full scans | Daily, weekly, monthly schedules       |

  - Load-balanced scanning
  - Scan result deduplication
  - Change detection and alerting
```

### Scenario: Scan Result Analysis and Reporting
```gherkin
Given scan results need analysis and action
When processing scan results
Then provide comprehensive analysis:
  | Analysis Type        | Output                                 |
  | Discovery summary   | New certificates found                 |

  - Trend analysis over time
```

### Scenario: Integration with Certificate Inventory
```gherkin
Given discovered certificates must be tracked

```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Network Timeouts and Unreachable Hosts
```gherkin
Given network issues may prevent scanning
When encountering network problems
Then:
  - Implement intelligent retry mechanisms
  - Use adaptive timeout strategies
  - Queue failed scans for retry
  - Provide partial result handling
  - Alert on persistent failures
```

### Edge Case: Rate Limiting and Scan Detection
```gherkin
Given security systems may block scanning
When scan blocking is detected
Then:
  - Implement scan rate adaptation
  - Use distributed scanning sources
  - Provide stealth scanning options
  - Support authenticated scanning
  - Coordinate with security teams
```

### Edge Case: Large Certificate Deployments
```gherkin
Given some hosts may have many certificates
When discovering large certificate sets
Then:
  - Handle thousands of certificates per host
  - Implement efficient batch processing
  - Provide memory-efficient scanning
  - Support incremental result streaming
  - Optimise storage for large datasets
```

### Edge Case: Dynamic Infrastructure
```gherkin
Given cloud infrastructure changes rapidly
When scanning dynamic environments
Then:
  - Support ephemeral host detection
  - Track certificate mobility
  - Handle auto-scaling groups
  - Integrate with cloud events
  - Maintain historical context
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given scanning tools can be security risks
Then implement comprehensive security:
  | Security Control     | Implementation                         |
  | Scan Authorisation  | Require approval for scan execution    |
  | Credential protection| Secure storage of scan credentials    |
  | Result encryption   | Encrypt scan results in transit/rest   |
  | Access controls    | Role-based access to scan functions    |
  | Audit logging      | Complete audit trail of scan activities|
  | Network isolation  | Scan from dedicated security zones     |
  | Input validation   | Validate all scan parameters           |
  | Resource limits    | Prevent resource exhaustion attacks    |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given scanning must not impact production systems
Then meet these performance targets:
  | Performance Metric   | Target                                 |
  | Scan speed         | 1000+ hosts per minute                 |
  | Certificate processing| 10,000+ certificates per minute       |
  | Memory usage       | < 2GB for scanner instance             |
  | Network bandwidth  | < 10% of available bandwidth           |
  | CPU usage         | < 25% on scanner host                  |
  | Storage efficiency | < 1KB per discovered certificate       |
```
