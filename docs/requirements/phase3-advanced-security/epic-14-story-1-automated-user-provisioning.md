# 14.1 - Automated User Provisioning

## User Story
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** automated user provisioning with self-service capabilities  
**So that** users can quickly gain appropriate access while maintaining security and compliance

## INVEST Criteria
- **Independent**: User provisioning can be developed separately from other features
- **Negotiable**: Provisioning workflows and approval chains are configurable
- **Valuable**: Reduces manual effort and improves security through consistent provisioning
- **Estimable**: 3 sprints for complete automated provisioning system
- **Small**: Focused on user provisioning and initial access grants only
- **Testable**: Provisioning accuracy and timing are measurable

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Self-Service User Registration
```gherkin
Given users need certificate management access
When initiating self-service registration
Then provide comprehensive registration workflow:
{
  "registration_workflow": {
    "identity_verification": {
      "methods": ["email_verification", "sms_otp", "manager_approval", "hr_integration"],
      "multi_factor_required": true,
      "identity_proofing": {
        "level": "NIST_IAL2",
        "document_verification": true,

```

### Scenario: Intelligent Role Assignment
```gherkin
Given users need appropriate permissions
When assigning roles during provisioning
Then implement intelligent role assignment:
  | Assignment Method    | Implementation                         |
  | Role mining         | Analyse similar users' access patterns |
  | Department mapping  | Auto-assign based on Organisational unit|

  | Risk-based assignment| Limit high-risk roles automatically   |
And provide role management:
  - Role catalog with descriptions
  - Permission preview before assignment
  - Conflict detection
  - Least privilege enforcement
  - Role expiration options
```

### Scenario: Multi-Stage Approval Workflows
```gherkin
Given different access levels require different approvals
When processing provisioning requests
Then implement flexible approval workflows:
  | Access Level         | Approval Requirements                  |
  | Basic read access   | Manager approval only                  |
  | Certificate creation| Manager + Security team               |
  | Admin access        | Manager + Security + Executive         |
  | Privileged access   | Multiple approvals + time limitation   |
  | Emergency access    | Break-glass with post-approval         |
And support workflow features:
  - Parallel and sequential approvals
  - Conditional approval paths
  - Approval delegation
  - Mobile approval capabilities
  - Approval justification requirements
```

### Scenario: Identity Provider Integration
```gherkin
Given Organisations use various identity providers
When integrating with identity systems
Then support multiple providers:
  | Provider Type        | Integration Features                   |
  | Active Directory    | Real-time sync, group mapping          |
  | LDAP               | Attribute mapping, SSL/TLS support     |
  | SAML 2.0           | SSO, assertion mapping                 |

  - Attribute mapping and transformation
  - Group membership sync
  - Multi-domain support
  - Conflict resolution
```

### Scenario: Automated Onboarding Workflows
```gherkin
Given new employees need immediate access
When onboarding new users
Then automate the complete workflow:
  | Onboarding Stage     | Automated Actions                      |
  | Pre-arrival         | Create account, assign baseline access |
  | Day 1               | Activate account, send welcome email   |
  | Training period     | Grant training environment access      |
  | Training completion | Upgrade to production access           |
  | Probation end       | Full permission activation             |
And coordinate with systems:
  - HR system integration for start dates
  - IT asset management for equipment
  - Training system for completion tracking
  - Email system for account creation
  - Badge system for physical access
```

### Scenario: Just-In-Time (JIT) Access Provisioning
```gherkin
Given some access should be granted only when needed
When implementing JIT access
Then provide dynamic provisioning:
  | JIT Scenario         | Implementation                         |
  | Elevated privileges | Grant admin access for specific window |
  | Project-based access| Provision for project duration         |
  | Vendor access       | Time-limited external access           |
  | Emergency access    | Break-glass with automatic revocation  |
  | Rotation access     | On-call engineer permissions           |
And implement JIT features:
  - Automatic provisioning triggers
  - Time-based access windows
  - Automatic deprovisioning
  - Access extension workflows
  - Audit trail for all JIT access
```

### Scenario: Segregation of Duties (SoD) Enforcement
```gherkin
Given certain role combinations create conflicts
When provisioning user access
Then enforce SoD policies:
  | Conflict Type        | Prevention Mechanism                   |
  | Role conflicts      | Prevent conflicting role assignments   |
  | Transaction conflicts| Block incompatible permissions        |
  | Approval conflicts  | Prevent self-approval scenarios        |
  | Certification conflicts| Separate cert creation and approval |
  | Audit conflicts     | Isolate audit from operational roles   |
And provide SoD management:
  - Conflict detection algorithms
  - Risk assessment for violations
  - Compensating control options
  - Exception workflows
  - SoD violation reporting
```

### Scenario: Access Certification Campaigns
```gherkin
Given user access must be periodically reviewed
When conducting access reviews
Then automate certification campaigns:
  | Campaign Type        | Automation Features                    |
  | Quarterly reviews   | Automatic campaign scheduling          |
  | Manager reviews     | Distribute reviews to managers         |
  | Privileged access   | Monthly certification required         |
  | Dormant accounts    | Flag unused accounts for review        |

And implement review features:
  - Bulk review capabilities
  - Risk-based review prioritization
  - Decision recommendation engine
  - Escalation for non-response
  - Certification reporting
```

### Scenario: Automated Deprovisioning
```gherkin
Given users leave or change roles
When deprovisioning is required
Then automate the process:
  | Trigger Event        | Deprovisioning Actions                 |
  | Termination         | Immediate access revocation            |
  | Role change         | Remove old permissions, add new        |
  | Department transfer | Adjust access per new department       |
  | Contract expiration | Scheduled deprovisioning              |
  | Security incident   | Emergency access suspension            |
And ensure completeness:
  - Certificate revocation
  - Session termination
  - API key invalidation
  - Audit log generation
  - Manager notification
```

### Scenario: Orphaned Account Detection
```gherkin
Given accounts may become orphaned
When detecting orphaned accounts
Then implement detection mechanisms:
  | Detection Method     | Implementation                         |
  | Manager departure   | Flag accounts with departed managers   |
  | No recent activity  | Identify dormant accounts              |
  | Missing HR record   | Accounts without employee records      |
  | Expired contracts   | Contractor accounts past end date      |
  | System accounts     | Service accounts without owners        |
And provide remediation:
  - Automatic manager reassignment
  - Dormant account suspension
  - Owner identification workflows
  - Account recertification
  - Cleanup procedures
```

## Edge Cases and Security Considerations

### Edge Case: Mass Onboarding Events
```gherkin
Given Organisations may onboard many users simultaneously
When processing bulk provisioning
Then:
  - Support CSV/bulk import with validation
  - Implement queuing for large batches
  - Provide progress tracking
  - Enable partial failure handling
  - Maintain performance under load
```

### Edge Case: Complex Approval Chains
```gherkin
Given some requests require many approvers
When approval chains are complex
Then:
  - Handle circular approval prevention
  - Support approval timeouts and escalation
  - Provide approval chain visualization
  - Enable approval process modification
  - Maintain audit trail integrity
```

### Edge Case: Identity Provider Outages
```gherkin
Given identity providers may be unavailable
When IdP outages occur
Then:
  - Implement failover mechanisms
  - Cache essential user data
  - Support offline provisioning
  - Queue Synchronisation updates
  - Provide manual override options
```

### Edge Case: Retroactive Access Requests
```gherkin
Given users may need past-dated access
When retroactive provisioning is requested
Then:
  - Support backdated access with justification
  - Require additional approvals
  - Generate compliance alerts
  - Maintain accurate audit timeline
  - Flag for additional review
```

## Security Hardening

```gherkin
Given user provisioning is a critical security process
Then implement comprehensive security:
  | Security Control     | Implementation                         |
  | Identity verification| Multi-factor authentication required   |
  | Approval integrity  | Digital signatures on approvals        |
  | Audit trail        | Immutable provisioning history         |
  | Privilege escalation| Prevent unauthorized role elevation    |
  | Data protection    | Encrypt sensitive user attributes      |
  | Session security   | Secure provisioning sessions           |
  | API security       | Rate limiting and authentication       |
  | Fraud detection    | Anomaly detection in provisioning      |
```

## Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given provisioning must be completed quickly
Then meet these performance targets:
  | Performance Metric   | Target                                 |
  | Registration time   | < 2 minutes for self-service           |
  | Approval routing    | < 30 seconds to route request          |
  | Account creation    | < 1 minute after approval              |
  | Permission sync     | < 5 minutes to all systems             |
  | Bulk provisioning   | 100+ users per minute                  |
  | Search performance  | < 1 second for user lookups            |
```
